## Account Abstraction

- [The Complex: a new protocol for reusable resource locks](https://x.com/z0age/status/1861420959665639450 "https://x.com/z0age/status/1861420959665639450")

  - currently, most cross-chain swap architectures initiate a swap on an origin chain by placing funds into escrow, then release funds once some condition (e.g. receiving a token on a destination chain) has been met
  - disadvantage:

    - fillers get an exclusive option to fill the swap, incentivizing them to wait to fill or walk away from bad fills
    - swap failures result in jank in-between states

  - Permit2, but instead of approving your tokens it wraps your tokens
  - as part of wrapping tokens, the depositor designates an "allocator" and a "reset period"

    - this allocator then has the ability to temporarily block token transfers for a window of time
    - the time window cannot exceed the reset period set by the depositor (the default is 10 minutes)

- [A new ERC-7579 reference implementation for EIP-7702](https://blog.rhinestone.wtf/getting-smart-accounts-eip-7702-ready-27bf028a21c9 "https://blog.rhinestone.wtf/getting-smart-accounts-eip-7702-ready-27bf028a21c9")

  - It solves

    - Storage collisions
    - Initialisation frontrunning

  - We also introduce "in-time initialization," allowing EOAs to adopt gas abstraction and batching without fully initializing the account.

- [Resource Lock Hook: A New Building Block for Modular Smart Accounts](https://blog.rhinestone.wtf/resource-lock-hook-335590cec733 "https://blog.rhinestone.wtf/resource-lock-hook-335590cec733")

  - **Account-native resource locks**
  - The existing account-native resource lock models (co-signer and escrow) have many trade-offs that either deteriorate the user experience or compromise the composability and interoperability of the user’s Smart Account.

    - **Co-signer:** An offchain system co-signs all transactions only if those transactions do not violate a pre-committed guarantee to a counterparty. In the context of Smart Accounts, a co-signer is installed as a (Signature) Validator Module on the account.

      - The advantage of this approach is that the complexities of managing resource locks are taken offchain, and with every user action (cross-chain intent or not) flowing through this root validator, it’s simpler to manage security threats that would allow the user to double-spend the system.
      - The downside of the co-signer approach is that every transaction from the account must be reviewed and verified by this offchain system.The more significant externality of all userOp validations going through a co-signer is that it limits the composability of the Smart Account. All Validator Modules installed on the account must have the co-signer integrated.
      - _There are many approaches to running these co-signer entities with lower trust requirements, such as MPC and TEEs, but this is not the focus of the article._

    - **Escrow:** Funds are moved to a separate contract with user access restricted to provide guarantees to external parties.

      - The core benefit of the escrow approach is that it isolates the resource locking to a purpose-built contract. Smart Accounts are built to give users maximum access and control over their assets. Resource locking within the Smart Account requires greater complexity onchain to ensure dishonest users cannot double-spend the system.
      - Escrows require an extra deposit step from the Smart Account. This step must be abstracted for this model to feel “account-native.” Over time, users will come to expect their entire balance to be chain abstracted, and for this to be true, their entire balance must permanently reside in an escrow.

    - Resource Lock Hook: There is no separation of funds or requirement for a root signature validator module that co-signs all transactions.

      - The Resource Lock Hook is a Smart Account Module that hooks into every execution and checks a simple invariant: will the execution, any approvals made during execution, reduce the account balance below the resource locked amount? If false, the Resource Lock Hook allows the transaction to pass. If true, the transaction will only pass with a signature from an offchain sequencer that performs a similar function to the co-signer discussed above (or an “Allocator” in the case of [the Compact](https://github.com/Uniswap/the-compact "https://github.com/Uniswap/the-compact")).

  - The Resource Lock Hook module will support [@safe](https://x.com/safe "https://x.com/safe") (via the Safe7579 adapter) and the [@Biconomy](https://x.com/biconomy "https://x.com/biconomy") Nexus in Q1 2025, with more account support on the way.

- [@AmbireWallet has implemented ERC-7677: gas sponsorship, and enabled it through Legends](https://x.com/borislavItskovv/status/1869372081269625321 "https://x.com/borislavItskovv/status/1869372081269625321")

  - ERC-7677 is an extension of the ERC-5792 dapp<->wallet communication protocol.

  - The best part is EIP7702 solves one of the biggest issues with stealth address,of gas sponsorship for the private new stealth EOA

## Block Supply Chain

- [BuilderNet](https://buildernet.org/blog/introducing-buildernet "https://buildernet.org/blog/introducing-buildernet")

  - Major orderflow providers made **exclusive orderflow deals with block builders** to internalize their MEV.
  - These opaque off-chain agreements have entrenched a duopoly in the builder market and created an unequal playing field for apps and users who do not have access to the same [preferential treatment](https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/11663492262641 "https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/11663492262641") — eroding the overall neutrality, censorship resistance, and resilience of Ethereum.
  - To advance these goals, the first release of BuilderNet introduces a “multioperator” system where many parties can operate the same block builder for the first time. Each operator runs an instance of an [open source builder](https://github.com/flashbots/rbuilder "https://github.com/flashbots/rbuilder") in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), which orderflow providers (like apps, wallets, users, and searchers) can verify and send encrypted orderflow to. Each instance shares the orderflow it receives with other instances in the network and submits blocks to MEV-Boost relays as usual. After a BuilderNet instance wins a block, refunds are calculated and distributed back to orderflow providers based on the value they added to the block.
  - [Flashbots migrated their builders, orderflow, and refunds to BuilderNet.](https://x.com/SheaKetsdever/status/1866124213628936418 "https://x.com/SheaKetsdever/status/1866124213628936418")
  - [BuilderNet Dune](https://dune.com/flashbots/buildernet "https://dune.com/flashbots/buildernet")

- [How much is a transaction worth? Priority fees are a good start, but they don’t tell the whole story.](https://x.com/SheaKetsdever/status/1869400368280732092 "https://x.com/SheaKetsdever/status/1869400368280732092")

  - It’s also an open area of research for BuilderNet. Because how much value a transaction adds to a block impacts how much it will be refunded.
  - [Refund rule: wat dis, how to and FAQ](https://collective.flashbots.net/t/refund-rule-wat-dis-how-to-and-faq/4049 "https://collective.flashbots.net/t/refund-rule-wat-dis-how-to-and-faq/4049")

    - **Simplified example:** The refund builder receives two mutually exclusive arbs at 5 & 6 ETH and two mutually exclusive liquidations at 1 & 4 ETH.
    - Assuming no interaction between the arb and the liquidation, the total block value is 4 + 6 = 10, the biggest arb contributes 5 - 6 = 1 ETH and the biggest liquidation bundle contributes 4 - 1 = 3 ETH.
    - If in the block auction, the builder has to pay c = 6 or less, everyone is refunded their full contribution.
    - If the builder pays c = 8, everyone is refunded half their contribution.

- [BuilderNet may not works](https://x.com/StanleyHe17/status/1861973042114793789 "https://x.com/StanleyHe17/status/1861973042114793789")

  - Big orderflow sources could get bigger refund from non-BuilderNet builders that's disproportionate to their value contribution because they are disproportionately important in a marginal bidding.

    - Say [@BananaGunBot](https://x.com/BananaGunBot "https://x.com/BananaGunBot") txns generate 4 ETH value in total, and the rest of the block generates 6 ETH, so block value = 10 ETH, and BuilderNet wins the auction with a bid of 7 ETH, then [@BananaGunBot](https://x.com/BananaGunBot "https://x.com/BananaGunBot") should get (4/10)\*(10-7)=1.2 ETH refund.
    - But it's easy to see that guys like [@BananaGunBot](https://x.com/BananaGunBot "https://x.com/BananaGunBot") and M\*taM\*sk are kingmakers - their size means they can usually sway the mev-boost auction outcome singlehandedly. [@titanbuilderxyz](https://x.com/titanbuilderxyz "https://x.com/titanbuilderxyz")'s win rate skyrocketed right after getting exclusive deal with Bananagun.
    - If i were a builder, i would be willing to pay 2.9 ETH to Banana in the above case, assuming the rest of the block is easy to get

  - Bigger BuilderNet =? Smaller validator revenue

    - BuilderNet is a network of builders. After competition/coordination between builder in TEE, a block is produced by BuilderNet to compete in mev-boost auction.
    - The weaker outside competition is, the stronger incentive BuilderNet builders have to collude and shade bids, leading to decreasing validator revenue. And validators would then favor more builders outside BuilderNet.
    - So it's unlikely that most builders join BuilderNet - even if they do so, a non-BuilderNet instance will likely be kept. So far the network seems like a way for [@beaverbuild](https://x.com/beaverbuild "https://x.com/beaverbuild") to get private orderflow they lost to Titan.

- [SearcherNet](https://x.com/christine_dkim/status/1869467320462274796 "https://x.com/christine_dkim/status/1869467320462274796")

  - [Searching in TDX](https://collective.flashbots.net/t/searching-in-tdx/3902 "https://collective.flashbots.net/t/searching-in-tdx/3902")

    - Intel TDX is a confidential VM, which expands the boundary a user can trust with confidential data from only an application enclave in Intel SGX to an entire VM in Intel TDX (Figure 1). Confidential VMs enable developers to deploy unmodified code that can run with near-native performance in private settings, making TEEs a practical and compelling privacy solution for MEV use cases.

## MEV

- [Introduction to MEV Mitigation](https://mirror.xyz/julianma.eth/rcXa7B5y14tbfFWwOqSVHcNOzzmNKOG0EfZJAn_qom4 "https://mirror.xyz/julianma.eth/rcXa7B5y14tbfFWwOqSVHcNOzzmNKOG0EfZJAn_qom4")

  - Instead of maximizing the value Ethereum facilitates by minimizing the MEV extracted from users, the in-protocol mechanisms aim to maximize Ethereum’s credible neutrality by minimizing the **negative externalities** of MEV.
  - MEV not only decreases the utility of those extracted from, **it also greatly distorts the behavior of the extractor, for example, it incentivizes centralization through economies of scale and causes** [**consensus instability**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09032 "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09032")**.**

## Preconf

- [Preconfirmations in Taiko Gwyneth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHpmNmt6lA4 "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHpmNmt6lA4")

- [Trustless Orderflow Operations Layer](https://x.com/0x9212ce55/status/1861088307548946495 "https://x.com/0x9212ce55/status/1861088307548946495")

  - A network of tee nodes pre-process the transaction and guarantee that once the transaction lands on ethereum it yields same state.
  - This system expects the proposer of the next block to be opted in (directly or through 3rd party sidecars) to secure these guarantees. So confirmations issued by the Network will be correct at the next block.

- [MEV-Commit Whitepaper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c--a2f1Wc7Y3hbpUqHLP0mTZlo-ycOOd/view "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c--a2f1Wc7Y3hbpUqHLP0mTZlo-ycOOd/view")

  - transaction delays, uncertain inclusion order, and the risk of reorganizations (reorgs) can disrupt transaction execution and user experience.
  - Introduce insured commitments, a protocol framework where providers

    guarantee certain conditions, compensating users if these conditions are not met.

- [EIP-7833: Scheduled function calls](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7833 "https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7833")

  - a new opcode, OFFERCALL, which allows contracts to schedule function calls. When functions self-schedule, they exhibit bot-like behavior. These scheduled calls would offer ETH to block producers as an incentive to prioritize their execution over manually submitted transactions. If the offer is not fulfilled, the bot is deactivated until manually re-ignited by the owner.

## Rollup

- [booster rollup](https://x.com/gwyneth_taiko/status/1869396137313972397 "https://x.com/gwyneth_taiko/status/1869396137313972397")

  - booster rollups are rollups that execute transactions **as if they are executed on L1**, having access to all the L1 state, but they also have their own storage.

  - Rollups can import the L1 state root into L2 to facilitate message passing between the two layers, such as user deposits and cross-chain contract calls. However, because the EVM cannot access the state root of the current block, rollups can only pull in state roots from past blocks. This restriction makes it impossible for rollups to process L1→L2 messages within the same slot using the state root alone.

  - By combining this protocol with the L2→L1 withdrawal mechanism discussed in our [previous post 10](https://ethresear.ch/t/fast-and-slow-l2-l1-withdrawals/21161 "https://ethresear.ch/t/fast-and-slow-l2-l1-withdrawals/21161"), users can execute composable L1<>L2 bundles, such as depositing ETH from L1, swapping it for USDC on L2, and withdrawing back to L1—all within a single slot.

  - Native Rollup Execution: Imagine transforming the current Ethereum L1 into a native rollup. In this model, transactions are processed off-chain in batches, which means way more transactions per second and lower fees. On-chain, we’d just post periodic proofs or state commitments to keep everything secure.
    - Batch Processing & State Commitment
    - Optimized Execution Environment
    - Security Inheritance
  - A Dedicated Deposit/Withdrawal L1: At the same time, we’d create a new Layer 1 right from genesis. This chain would serve as the gateway for asset deposits and withdrawals, working hand-in-hand with the beacon chain. To keep things simple and secure, it would run with a super low gas limit—around 10 million or even less—since it’s only doing the basics of moving assets around and not intended for Defi or applications.

  - Skipped Transactions
    - Upfront Fee Payment by Coinbase: To protect the network against the cost of including these transactions, the block proposer’s account (known as the COINBASE) pays an upfront “inclusion cost.” This cost covers basic expenses like the base transaction cost and calldata fees.
    - ![](https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/9/e/9e2b6c9f9fa49053698138194c94656f3e755c4a.png)
    - Delayed execution could create new opportunities for direct sponsorship. Since the coinbase already covers the inclusion cost upfront, it might be reasonable to extend this responsibility to the base fee as well.

- [Consolidation incentives in Orbit/Vorbit SSF](https://ethresear.ch/t/consolidation-incentives-in-orbit-vorbit-ssf/21593)

  - A key proposition of Orbit SSF is that validators rotate based on size, such that those with larger balances are active more frequently, while still giving all validators roughly equal yield.
  - Active validators can be slashed, so large validators will therefore assume greater risk than small validators.
  - We must therefore provide some incentives to ensure consolidation in the staking set.

- [Native rollups—superpowers from L1 execution](http://ethresear.ch/t/native-rollups-superpowers-from-l1-execution/21517#p-52332-part-1the-execute-precompile-1)
  - We propose an elegant and powerful EXECUTE precompile exposing the native L1 EVM execution engine to the application layer. A native execution rollup, or “native rollup” for short, is a rollup which uses EXECUTE to verify EVM state transitions for batches of user transactions.
  - One can think of native rollups as “programmable execution shards” that wrap the precompile within a derivation function to handle extra-EVM system logic, e.g. sequencing, bridging, forced inclusion, governance.
  - benefits
    - simplicity
    - security
    - EVM equivalence
    - SNARK gas cost
    - synchronous composability
      - Today synchronous composability with the L1 requires same-slot real-time proving. For zk rollups achieving ultra-low-latency proving, e.g. on the order of 100ms, is an especially challenging engineering task.
      - With one-slot delayed state root the proving latency underlying the native execution precompile can be relaxed to one full slot.

- [Gossipsub Network Diameter Estimate](https://ethresear.ch/t/gossipsub-network-diameter-estimate/21561)
  - The Gossipsub network diameter for Ethereum is estimated to be seven, meaning it takes seven steps for a message to reach all nodes.
  - The number of new infections rises until round five, after which it declines as fewer nodes remain uninfected.
  - A significant increase in duplicate messages occurs during rounds five and six due to many nodes being newly infected with fewer targets available.

## Rollup

- [ULTRA TX - Programmable blocks: One transaction is all you need for a unified and extendable Ethereum](https://ethresear.ch/t/ultra-tx-programmable-blocks-one-transaction-is-all-you-need-for-a-unified-and-extendable-ethereum/21673)
  ![](https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/b/a/baf3febd4fb4ecd920011aa4433f4f5c2c2e8dde_2_1380x764.png)
  ![](https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/4/6/466285b38d168edd1e90f303045a8af0769cbb80.png)

  - The outputs generated by the extensions called on L1 are stored in the ExtensionOracle contract. These values are set before the call is done as part of the ULTRA TX. The ExtensionOracle is a simple contract that provides the output for each call that is not actually supported by L1. This data is stored in transient storage.
  - Now we can actually do the call. Each call to extended functionality checks if the call is supported in the environment it’s currently executing:
    - If it’s supported, then the call happens as normal. e.g. the call is actually done to the target contract. This is the path that is followed in the builder/prover.
    - If it’s not supported, it means the call instead should be redirected to the ExtensionOracle smart contract where the call output generated offchain will be read instead. This is the path that is followed on L1.
  - This extra data is generated and provided by the master builder, not by the user. The user doesn’t have to sign any additional data or verify expensive proofs. The user can interact with smart contracts using extended functionality exactly the same way the user interacts with native functionality.

  - The universal intents engine is split into four parts:
    1. Message Standard
    2. Broadcast Standard
    3. Fast Settlement
    4. Intent Dissemination Feed
  - Launching Q1 2025, this will allow integrated @arbitrum chains and other Ethereum L2s to achieve < 3s crosschain asset transfers.

  - an effort to coordinate and standardize various components needed for based rollups.

- [GLUE builds on an interop approach inspired by Gwyneth, which itself is a minimal EVM extension for cross-chain calls.](https://x.com/gwyneth_taiko/status/1882875751831306421)

  1. standardize a way transactions can be exchanged between L2s
     - these transactions are generated by the source chain, executed and proven by the destination chain, and checked for consistency between both.
  2. to ensure L2s don’t have to trust each other, we can use a neutral intermediary chain (like Gwyneth or a native rollup).
  3. efficient composability with L1 is also critical. instead of reading all L1 data on L2, we can reexecute L1 blocks to calculate the latest L1 state at the time the L2 block is proposed.
     - this allows L2s to access L1 state at L2 costs, reducing overhead.
     - Other approach: read all L1 data that is accessed on L2 first and then pass that data into the L2.

  - Bringing it all together
    - a builder creates a super block containing all transactions for all chains. this super block is broken into pieces, proven by L2 provers, and posted onchain.
    - the blocks are then proposed to L1 and a final proof proves everything together.

  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GhxzgJzXEAATc4h?format=jpg&name=medium)
  - Booster rollups not only build upon the foundation laid by based rollups but also push the boundaries of Ethereum's composability
  - Booster rollups process transactions as if on L1, with access to L1's state but with separate storage, scaling both execution and storage to L2. Each L2 extends L1's blockspace, distributing transaction processing and data storage.
  - Envision deploying your decentralized application (dapp) just once, and it automatically scales across all Layer 2 (L2) networks.
  - booster rollups can be also described as "distribute the execution of transactions and storage across multiple shards.”

  - One reason why @SuccinctLabs
    SP1 is so fast is because they use mult-set hash functions to check memory reads+writes.

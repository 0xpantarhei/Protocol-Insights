## Account Abstraction

- [what are Resource Locks, and how do they work?](https://x.com/ankitchiplunkar/status/1869744809986117765)
  ![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GfKpUGOXQAAj1kX?format=jpg&name=medium)

  - Resource Locks (RLs) allow users to delegate transaction inclusion to a 3rd party, relinquishing their ability to cancel signed transactions
  - This gives solvers equivocation protection, allowing them to fill user intent instantly without waiting for confirmations
  - RLs are non-custodial with a trust model similar to a rollup sequencer
  - RLs handles transaction inclusion but can't spend funds. In case of censorship, users can rage-quit
  - RLs can take many forms onchain:

  - Open dapps vs Closed dapps
  - Focus on open dapps

    - How do you know if a connected wallet is a smart wallet?
      - ERC-5792 defines a standard RPC `wallet_getCapabilities` which returns a list of “capabilities” that the wallet supports.
      - Luckily, `Viem` and `Wagmi` already support wallet_getCapabilities, so you are just one function/hook away from using this RPC.
    - If your user connects with a smart wallet, what do you do?

      - Generally, you should decide whether a capability is required or optional for your dapp.
      - In practice, capabilities follow a 80-20 rule where a few capabilities are able to satisfy most use cases.

        - Transaction batching
          - ERC-5792
        - Gas sponsorship
          - ERC-7677
        - Permissions (sometimes known as “session keys”)
          - For permissions, standardization is much harder because there are so many possible approaches, including session keys, session accounts (ERC-7710), and sub accounts (ERC-7895). One attempt at unifying these approaches is ERC-7715 but it’s an ongoing effort.
        - Chain abstraction
          - “Chain abstraction” is a rapidly developing area with even more competing approaches, but the good news is that it doesn’t require any complicated wallet interface, which makes standardization easier. Right now there are at least two ERCs (ERC-7682 and ERC-7811) that address chain abstraction, but they are still at an early stage of adoption.

  - Existing Safe contracts cannot be used with EIP-7702, because of following reasons:
    - Delegating to Safe Singleton or the Safe Proxy contract will expose the EOA account to the risk of front-running during setup.
    - In its current implementation, the Safe Singleton contract doesn't let itself to become an owner meaning that after delegating to the Safe Singleton, the EOA account cannot sign Safe transactions and will need to keep another private key to do so.

  - Before T1 — Users post sealed txs consisting of a cryptographic hash computed from the raw tx and its associated ToB fee.
  - T1 — Proposers add sealed txs from the encrypted mempool to a commitment struct in Block A.
  - T2 — Once a user observes their sealed tx in a block, they broadcast the unsealed raw tx pointing to it.
  - T3 — Attesters locally observe the timeliness of unsealed txs and verify that their hashes match the original commitments.
  - T4 — The proposer orders txs top-of-block in Block B, sorted according to the unsealed fee.
  - T5 — Attesters confirm with their attestation, contingent on correct collation.
- [Doubling the blob count with Gossipsub v2.0](https://x.com/n1shantd/status/1897832817138319700)
  - Gossipsub currently eagerly pushes messages, we add to it with a new lazy pull mechansim.
    - The tradeoff of the current design is if a network requires messages to be propagated with minimal latency it requires a large amount of amplification. This is problematic in networks which need to propagate large messages, as the amplification done is significant. If many of these large messages start being propagated in a network it would affect the general decentralization and scalability of the network.
  - Instead of broadcasting messages to your whole mesh, you only send to a subset of them.
  - The rest of the peers receive announcements instead. What does this achieve ? It greatly reduces the amount of duplicates in the network.

- [EIP-7917: Deterministic proposer lookahead](https://x.com/linoscope/status/1904936974852776239)

  - Proposer schedule (the "lookahead") unpredictability at epoch boundaries has been a long-lasting pain point, especially for preconfirmation protocols where the upcoming proposer must be known in advance.
  - Lookahead depends on both RANDAO & validator effective balances (EBs).The next epoch’s RANDAO seed is known at epoch start, but EBs (which can change mid-epoch from rewards, etc.) finalize at epoch end. This misalignment causes unpredictability.
    ![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gm-qPDnb0AEEqmq?format=jpg&name=medium)
  - he fix is simple: EIP‑7917 aligns the EB and RANDAO timing so the next epoch’s lookahead can always be calculated deterministically—no more last-minute changes from mid-epoch EB shifts.

- [A lazy approach to slashers](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-lazy-approach-to-slashers/22041)
  - In short, slashers are heavy resource consuming beacon nodes that keep a very large database of every single attestation cast by every single validator for the last few months.
    - The bottleneck for slashers is the handling of surround attestations.
  - simple observations
    - Violating attestations are only really harmful if included in blocks.
    - Violating attestations are only really harmful if there are many attestations being cast at the same time.
    - Violating attestations typically require only a few blocks to be found.
  - In fact, slashers only need about 32 blocks to slash every offending validator. The reason for this is that all validators were chosen to attest during the first reverted epoch. And any of these attestations would be enough to slash these offending validators. An honest node that has kept the 32 blocks after the first invalid checkpoint, could have simply gone back looking for these bad attestations after the fact.

  - aren't based rollups just centralized sequencers given the proposers need to pick a gateway? decentralizing the gateway is the same as decentralizing the sequencer. something feels off to me.
  - Ans
    - gateways can be removed by proposers at any point in favor of another. You can’t do that with centralized sequencers. So you have the power to choose your centralized sequencer in a competitive environment.

- [L2 Blocks Are Stupid (But it's Fine)](https://x.com/ODesenfans/status/1898738478621274613)
  - L2s continue building blocks mainly for L1 software compatibility, but it's largely artificial. When posting summaries to L1, L2s typically batch multiple blocks together to reduce costs. While state commitments are needed occasionally for fraud/validity proofs, they aren't required for every block. Therefore, L2 blocks are essentially useless.
  - As a user, you care about one thing, timing-wise: the round-trip time. In more words, how much time will it take for my transaction to reach the L2 sequencer, get executed, and for the result to be visible on the RPC node I'm using? Let's focus on that last part: how much time does it take to communicate the execution of a transaction to RPCs?
- [Native Rollup Deposits by Passing L1 Context](https://hackmd.io/@peter-scroll/rJSKJAFnyx)
- [Native Rollups - Promises and Challenges](https://scroll.io/research/native-rollups-promises-and-challenges)
  - The key idea behind native rollups is to introduce a new EVM precompile that enables stateless verification of correct state transitions of other EVM instances.
  - Rollups can use this precompile to trustlessly settle on L1, offloading the burden of building and maintaining a proof system while inheriting more of Ethereum’s security guarantees.
  - `EXECUTE(pre-state-root, post-state-root, transactions_batch_and_state_witness)`
    - pre-state-root and post-state-root represent the Merklized state before and after the transition.
    - transactions_batch_and_state_witness includes the transactions to be executed along with Merkle proofs for necessary state reads and writes (referred to as "trace" in Justin Drake’s recent post).
      - Note that transactions_batch_and_state_witness is a blob versioned hash, just a pointer to the data that is available to Ethereum validators.
    - Additionally, most EXECUTE calls in a single block are likely independent, enabling parallel execution.
  - Scaling Up: Re-execution vs SNARKification
    - In this design, every L1 node must re-execute each EXECUTE call.
    - L1 execution clients could integrate SNARK provers and verifiers for EXECUTE.
      - Naively, when a node receives a block which includes EXECUTE invocations without accompanying proofs, after re-execution, it can generate the proofs and propagate it to its peers along the block.
      - So instead of every node re-executing, most would simply verify a SNARK proof per invocation.
    - However, generating a SNARK proof for a rollup batch currently takes 5–20 minutes, much longer than Ethereum’s 12-second slot time. This gap is expected to narrow to 5–10 seconds in the near future, making this approach viable alongside delayed post-state inclusion proposed in EIP-7862
    - Note that block builders, that are expected to be sophisticated entities under proposer-builder separation, will still need to eagerly execute the block.
  - DA inefficiencies
    - Remember that L1 nodes don’t have full-state of every rollup and they can only re-execute a batch of transactions for said rollup in an stateless mode; This necessitates state_witness as an input for EXECUTE precompile. It creates a significant additional DA cost for rollups that are posting full transaction data.
    - Secondly, rollups that are using this precompile can not operate in a state-diff mode or use any state-full compression methods.
  - Making EVM in EXECUTE more flexible
    - Partial Settlement via Auxiliary Proofs
    - Custom Opcode Overrides
    - Generalizing EXECUTE beyond EVM to RISC-V
    - Fundamental tension of customizability and achieving L1 security
  - Conclusion
    - The idea of exposing stateless verification of EVM execution inside EVM is truly powerful! Native rollups can be EVM-equivalent, governance-free, and immutable with no need for security councils whatsoever.
    - There is also a great potential to create an economic zone of based and native rollups that share sequencers and settlement, and can interoperate more easily as a result.
    - However, it would be fundamentally challenging for many existing rollups to adopt this paradigm since they are EVM-compatible in different ways and they use stateful or otherwise customized data compression for DA efficiencies.
- [Revisit Native Rollups](https://taiko.mirror.xyz/Mr5Fl0epl7ooCr5199yVrmGXWUV-IdYBHHtAwLXrp58)
  - Security.
    - Today's rollup designs must have security councils to update the chain due to potential bugs. With native rollups, all governance is handled by Ethereum's social consensus.
    - Native rollup operators no longer need to worry about bugs; the Ethereum community takes care of it.
  - Simplified synchronous composability with L1.
    - Based rollups come very close to achieving this, but it requires that L1 and L2 blocks are built at the same time by the same builder. Native rollups can do this without this requirement.
    - A native rollup could use the EXECUTE precompile to verify the state of another native rollup without requiring additional trust assumptions.
    - For read-only cross-rollup operations, a contract on rollup A could directly verify the state of rollup B by referencing B's latest state root and providing an appropriate witness trace showing the data exists in that state.
  - Forward Compatibility.
    - As the L1 EVM evolves, native rollups automatically inherit all improvements without requiring separate implementation work. This ensures long-term compatibility with Ethereum's roadmap.

  - With zkTLS, the handshake model of HTTPS is not optimized for ZK proofs, so you need an “attestor” in the middle
  - That said, zkTLS protocols are working on making the attestor trustless, through mechanisms like MPC, so it’s still incredibly powerful tech. Just not as beautifully elegant as zkEmail

## Account Abstraction

- [The diff between AA and ithaca](https://x.com/yoavw/status/1892721458331451493)
  - [ithaca](https://x.com/gakonst/status/1892629921039782213)
    - Fix validation to specific key types for predictable cost, remove the separation of validation/execution, combine 3 gas types to 1
      - ithaca decides which key types you should use.
    - Bake paymaster into Entrypoint / Account
      - ithaca figured out the perfect paymaster for everyone. No more innovation on gas abstraction models. I hope it supports ZK for privacy protocols at least.
    - User asks the relay for a signed fee quote offchain
      - nevermind the privacy protocol. The relay knows your IP anyway.
    - yep disregarding the permissionless mempool and assuming apps operate or have a deal with a service that lands txs
      - censorship resistance is dead.
  - AA
    - Permissionless innovatation on validation types: sig schemes, access control models, quantum resistance...
    - Permissionless innovation on gas abstraction models: pay gas with ERC-20, DAO sponsoring its voting (serverless), withdrawal from privacy protocols, trustless crosschain interop...
    - Privacy: not mandatory but available.
    - Censorship resistance: mempool not mandatory but available.
- [Zerodev Kernel's 7702 Support](https://x.com/leekt216/status/1891972586239922516)
  - goals
    - Front-running protection for 7702
    - A single implementation for both 7702 and smart contract wallets
      Here is the approach we took.
  - [approach](https://github.com/zerodevapp/kernel/pull/129)
    - Initialize protection
      - To prevent 7702 front running attack, we needed to disable the initialize function for 7702. So, Kernel now prevents initialize() calls if address(this).code starts with 0xef01, which indicates a 7702 account.
    - Root validation
      - Since initialize function is now disabled, there is not root validator set, and we need a way to rely on address(this) for the authentication. To achieve this, from Kernel v3.3, if there is no root validator set, Kernel automatically uses the 7702 verification method as the default root validation. This avoids additional transactions while maintaining security.

  - a major L2 infra team needs to vertically integrate their existing stack from the protocol to UX layer, and enable 1-click user interactions across their ecosystem’s rollups.
  - Where existing “solutions” like bridge aggregators fall short:
    - require users to leave dApps for external websites—killing retention
    - slow, often taking minutes to settle, because 1-second finality is impossible without controlling the rollup’s sequencing infra (esp. given Ethereum’s slow finality).
- [Introducing the Crosschain Broadcaster - A Building Block for Trustless Ethereum Interop](https://x.com/OffchainLabs/status/1892623329254646032)
  - [ERC](https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/pull/897)
  - a simple scenario
    - A user on Arbitrum One submits a message to the Broadcaster contract on Arbitrum One.
    - The Broadcaster contract stores that message in a unique slot on Arbitrum One.
    - On Base, someone wants to confirm that message indeed exists on Arbitrum One; they call the Receiver contract on Base and provide:
      - **a “route” of Pointer addresses that leads from Base (L2) to Ethereum (L1) to Arbitrum One (L2)**
      - **the necessary storage proofs for verification**
    - The Receiver on Base works through each Pointer/Prover in the route, eventually obtaining Arbitrum’s block hash and reading the Broadcaster’s storage.
    - If the message is found, the Receiver returns success plus a timestamp. This result can trigger an arbitrary action in a smart contract that is subscribed to the Receiver
- [Mesh vs Hub: Approaches to Rollup Interoperability](https://scroll.io/research/mesh-vs-hub-approaches-to-rollup-interoperability)
  ![](https://scroll.ghost.io/content/images/2025/01/Screenshot-2024-12-18-at-14.22.06-1.png)
  - This article focuses on native rollup interoperability solutions that require protocol-level integration.
  - We exclude external bridging solutions that rely on liquidity providers and **only support fungible token transfers.**
  - When two L2s interact at faster-than-Ethereum latency, there are three fundamental issues that rollups need to deal with: equivocation, invalidity, and non-settlement.
    - Equivocation: A rollup broadcasts conflicting states to different chains, effectively promising the same assets multiple times.
    - Invalidity: A state transition might never be provably correct on L1.
    - Non-settlement: The proof generation or settlement process might stall indefinitely.
  - Both non-settlement and invalidity will be trivially solved once real-time generation of zk proof becomes practical (a.k.a. real-time proving).
  - The problem of equivocation is however fundamentally different. A zk proof can prove that Alice sent 10 ETH to Bob on Arbitrum, but it does not guarantee that Scroll will commit this transition on L1.
  - The mesh model is where rollups are directly interconnected with each other in a clique where they all trust each other not to equivocate in order to achieve pre-settlement finality.
    - While mesh systems rely on trust for pre-settlement safety, they can detect equivocation at settlement, triggering reorgs across all connected rollups.
  - The hub model introduces a shared layer, which rollups rely on to handle equivocation-prevention of cross-chain interactions at faster-than-Ethereum latency.
    - Specifically, for pre-settlement equivocation-prevention, we must ensure that the hub will not collude with an equivocating rollup.
    - Hub systems thus replace the mutual trust between rollups in the mesh design, with trust in a single shared layer that must not collude with other rollups to equivocate.
- [@t1protocol are working on Real-Time Proving (RTP) to accelerate the settlement process](https://x.com/kisaguncan/status/1892248303670382648)
  - Instead of relying on optimistic verification (hours-long dispute periods), RTP-enabled proofs verify settlement in minutes.
  - Across Protocol currently handles ~$19M daily bridging volume (~9,500 TXs). A solver paid every 60 min needs ~$800K in inventory. If paid every min, they only need ~$13.5K—a 60x efficiency gain!

    - the Universal Registration Contract (URC) developed by the Ethereum sequencing community stores one withdrawal address that maps to multiple BLS keys, enabling node operators to manage many validators.
    - Optionally delegate to some preconf providers or gateways
      - You register to multiple gateways until you reach your blockspace capacity, but avoid over-committing as this could result in slashing.
      - Without delegation, you can build the preconfirmed batch yourself
    - With delegation, either the validator or the gateway is at fault. The challenger proves fault attribution with the protocol-defined evidence.

- [Max-Blobs Flag: Economic Perspective](https://ethresear.ch/t/max-blobs-flag-economic-perspective/21798)
  - The max-blobs flag, which allows local builders to limit the number of blobs included in a block
  - this feature gives local builders more control over block construction, helping them manage the workload of processing blob-heavy blocks.
  - Using the 'max-blobs' flag has a negligible economic impact, with an estimated loss of about 1.5 USD per block when limiting to three blobs.
  - Local builders who do not use MEV-Boost may miss out on some priority fees, but these losses are minor compared to the larger MEV rewards they could be missing.
  - The research suggests that while transactions with more blobs generally pay more overall, the priority fee remains nearly the same regardless of the number of blobs included.
    - Blob transactions do not have a direct priority fee; their inclusion is incentivized by the gas used in the transaction that carries them.

  - Technologies Enabling the Encrypted Mempool
    - timed cryptography in the style of Verifiable Delay Functions (VDFs) ❌
      - Timed cryptography requires a significant amount of wasteful computation and comes with timing issues
    - FHE ❌
      - FHE and witness encryption, while powerful primitives, are not yet practical for many real-world use cases
    - Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) ❌
      - TEEs are vulnerable to side-channel attacks and crucially require to trust the hardware manufacturer
    - Witness Encryption ❌
      - FHE and witness encryption, while powerful primitives, are not yet practical for many real-world use cases
    - Threshold Encryption ✅
      - threshold encryption relies on the threshold trust assumption, requiring that fewer than a specified number of parties act maliciously.
      - threshold encryption stands out as the most viable candidate for implementing an encrypted mempool in the near- to mid-term.
      - It allows for efficient decryption while offering robust security and liveness guarantees.
      - Threshold encryption works by distributing the decryption key of a public key encryption scheme among multiple parties, such that collaboration of a minimum threshold of parties is required to decrypt a message. This approach ensures that as long as fewer than the threshold number of parties are compromised, the plaintext and decryption key remain secure.

## Rollup

- [Arbitrum Bold (Bounded Liquidity Delay)](https://x.com/francescoweb3/status/1687764637159432192)

  - BOLD is able to provide a “fixed, upper bound 7 days of additional delay on confirmations” and doesn’t suffer from Delay Attacks
  - It does so, by supporting efficient “all-versus-all-disputes”, where even a single honest validator can win disputes against any number of malicious claims
  - As such, BOLD can resolve disputes among multiple parties efficiently in a single procedure rather than relying on the previous one-vs-one challenges.

  - "Does Sonic parallelize transaction execution in any way?". The answer, is no
  - Aida is an incredibly powerful tool that allows us to replay entire blockchains (any) in minutes instead of months with useful performance metrics baked in
  - The single biggest improvement, was DB, an 800% increase, next supersets, followed by consensus, and very low on that list, with a modest 30% improvement, was parallel execution.
  - why doesn't Sonic do single leader elected servers then?
    - One of our north starts that I wrote about back in 2018, was that as we see the advent of intercommunicating programs, at some point, consensus is required.

  - To bring a dapp to any L2, just deploy (and update) on L1. For each L2, a simple proxy contract can be deployed that does an L1DELEGATECALL to the L1 implementation contract.
  - If the app is deployed behind an upgradeable proxy, read the latest implementation address from L1 using L1CALL and then do an L1DELEGATECALL to that implementation contract.

  - Precompile
    - Contracts with code.length == 0 are Precompiles! They don't have EVM code but Node code.
    - Precompiles "ignore" function selectors, focusing on raw calldata.

  - Once the FraxSwap LP tokens are in hand (= liquidity provider on FraxSwap), lenders can deposit / withdraw these FraxSwap LP tokens, in the isolated markets corresponding to this pool, receive BAMM LP tokens & earn interests (from borrowers) if they are lent to borrowers.
  - the liquidity providers receive either trading fees or a yield from borrowers
    - real yield = (1 - BAMMUtility)*FraxSwapAPR + BAMMUtility*bammBorrowAPR

  - Both `noble-curves` and `foundry` should follow RFC6979 which defines a deterministic nonce derivation procedure, ensuring that signatures for the same input are identical.

- [Web2 Nullifiers using vOPRF](https://mirror.xyz/privacy-scaling-explorations.eth/L4LSAWflNocKolhV6ZVaqt3KDxdSjFPNSv0U5SCc__0)
  - In Semaphore users have their
    `public_id = hash(secret, nullifier)` - nullifier actually serves as an id of user - we still don't know who exactly used the system, but we'll be able to find out if they used it more than once.
  - But the thing is we don't have any nullifiers in ZK Email/TLS, etc. - that's why it's not possible to create such systems for Web2 identities out of the box. The solution for that is vOPRF.
    - vOPRFs (verifiable Oblivious PseudoRandom Functions) - are protocols that allow a client to generate deterministic random based on their input, while keeping it private.
    - So, there're two parties in the protocol - first one as I said is a client, and second one is a OPRF network (usually MPC is used for that).
    - With OPRF we'll be able to generate nullifiers for Web2 ID's': users will just need to ask the MPC to generate it, e.g., based on their email address (without revealing plain text of course).

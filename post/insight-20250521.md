## Account Abstraction

- [Metamask support `wallet_sendCalls`](https://x.com/MetaMaskDev/status/1908226140361109759)
- [Intents Are Eating ERC-4337](https://blog.rhinestone.wtf/intents-are-eating-erc-4337-891da7044fc2)
  - Userops (ERC-4337) are slow, complex, and high-cost.
  - Intents are fast, simple, and low-cost.
  - Intents can be chain agnostic (ERC-7683). Ethereum’s horizontal scaling strategy almost guarantees that intents will eat userops.
- [MEV strategy of frontrunning 4337 bundles on Polygon](https://x.com/_kanarazu_/status/1923483933519311210)
  - AA bundles often overpay for gas to avoid getting stuck during on-chain congestion.
    - take this [AA transaction](https://polygonscan.com/tx/0xf9d28a8176758c704c8634ebccabe40490b1acdbea27334cd95411a581f23873): the bundler paid 0.0048 POL and got refunded 0.0091 POL, almost double what it paid!
  - BlockNative had this “explorer” for AA transactions that showed pending ones on Polygon. (v1)
    - snoop on the Polygon mempool without running my own node, which would be expensive.
  - Run Reth for BlockNative discontinued their services (v2)
  - Run Rust instead of Typescript (v3)
  - Merkle and Bloxroute simply broadcast into the public mempool since there aren’t any private relays.
  - FastLane added an endpoint to their PFL protocol that offers revert protection for bundlers but subject to a speedbump of 2 blocks where the transactions would be broadcasted publicly.
    - They also ran experiments using FastLane’s conditional endpoint, but found that its validator coverage wasn’t high enough for their use case.
  - Pimlico tried to address by frontrunning
    - They’ve found a good solution now! The EntryPoint will call a Paymaster contract when paymaster data is included, and there’s a EOA address check that will be performed. This prevents frontrunning and will result in a revert if tried.
- [Mock-aa-environment](https://github.com/pimlicolabs/mock-aa-environment)

  - Docker containers to hold mock singleton paymaster + helpers to setup local AA environment

  - An alternative with ERC-7683
    - ERC-7682 is also important here, and is a more privacy centric way to tell the app "Don't worry about what assets the user has, I (the wallet) will handle helping them get what they need when and where they need it"
- [EntryPoint v0.8.0](https://mirror.xyz/0x836F73BE367a8215FCab4C15E5012DaF574b9Ce4/H2lUnhYyhsRWyTgKYh6hrm_OySrsgQDaRamWymMzMoA)

  - ERC-712 Based UserOperation Hash and Signatures:
    - Adopts ERC-712 standards to ensure compatibility with external signers like hardware wallets.
  - Optimized Unused Gas Penalty:
    - Removes the 10% penalty if the unused gas is below 40,000 units, improving efficiency without affecting network security.
  - Introducing the Simple7702Account Contract:
    - Adds a minimalist, fully audited smart contract wallet that complies with ERC standards such as ERC-165, ERC-721, ERC-1155, ERC-1271, and ERC-4337 v0.8.
  - Enhanced ERC-7562 Validation Rules:
    - Allows CREATE/CREATE2 opcodes during deployment.
    - Permits storage access for all staked entities.
    - Includes updated rules aligning with EIP-7702.

## Interop

- [Signal-Boost: L1 Interop Plugin for Rollups](https://ethresear.ch/t/signal-boost-l1-interop-plugin-for-rollups/22354)
  - Signal-Boost offers a practical path to synchronous composability for existing rollups (most rollups today are not based), without needing a full stack migration.
    - Our goal is for L2s to ingest and react to L1 state in real time. Same-slot messaging enables this by allowing data written on L1 to be consumed by L2s within the same L1 slot. But this only works for L1 data that is explicitly written to the SignalService contract.
    - This creates a key limitation: protocols like Chainlink or Uniswap would need to actively push their data to L2s, requiring changes to their contract logic.
    - Signal-Boost addresses this by adopting a request-before-push model. Instead of asking L1 contracts to emit signals, anyone can query arbitrary L1 view functions and push the results to the SignalService contract in a verifiable way. In practice, this is especially useful when done by the L2 sequencer.
    - However, it introduces new challenges: What happens if the signal changes mid-slot? How do L2 users respond or verify?
  - The insight: You don’t need the L1 proposer to sequence your rollup. You just need coordination between the L1 proposers and rollup sequencer.
  - Signal-Boost allows a sequencer to offer their users synchronous access to L1 data with few or no modifications to their rollup stacks.
    ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GrB-Rs4XgAArxAF?format=jpg&name=medium)
  - Signal-Boost works for both:
    - Classical rollups with dedicated sequencers
    - Based rollups with or without preconfs
- [Cross-Chain Messaging Gateway](https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/blob/master/ERCS/erc-7786.md)
- [A few more thoughts on intents + UX, and the relatively importance of L1 block times vs L1 finality vs L2 withdrawal windows.](https://x.com/hal2001/status/1918847908608364669)
  - is it to/from L1 --> slot times matter
  - is the value large --> finality matters
  - is it to/from longtail L2's --> exit window matters

## Block Pipeline

- [BuilderNet's won 14% of blocks today](https://x.com/metachris/status/1923105849578303954)
  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GrA-Y79XUAA_LI0?format=jpg&name=medium)
- [Arbitrum Timeboost Data](https://dune.com/entropy_advisors/arbitrum-timeboost)
  ![](https://x.com/tomwanhh/status/1923496541840380030/photo/1)
- [Relay Inclusion Lists](https://ethresear.ch/t/relay-inclusion-lists/22218)
  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GpZC5PiWgAA24wp?format=png&name=900x900)

  - A practical solution to enhance Ethereum’s censorship resistance without introducing protocol changes or new trust assumptions.

- [Optimistic V3 Relays](https://x.com/gattacahq/status/1907482182014165295)
  - - Builders submit only the block header and include an address for retrieving the payload from the builder on demand.
  - Relays retrieve the full payload only after a block is chosen by proposers.
  - Avoids builders dropping lower-value blobs or transactions due to bandwidth concerns.
- [Luban’s blob futures](https://x.com/lu_ban_/status/1907804686599770285)
  - Rollups can now pre-buy guaranteed future blobs at fixed prices, enabling stable settlement schedule and cost control.
  - How it works:
    - Proposers opt-in & delegate to underwriters
    - Rollups scan 2-epoch windows for opt-in slots
    - Rollups make payments to underwriters for future blobs
    - Underwriters enforce inclusion, absorbing real-time gas risk
- [Robust Preconfirmations via Zero-Knowledge Proofs](https://mirror.xyz/preconf.eth/AgtLSBob1hd2A924vlL7jCyJxQDZZE2tCq_K07w5vuU)
  - mev-commit incorporates end-to-end privacy such that when a commitment is issued, only the corresponding bidder and provider learn to which bid a commitment refers, the commitment contents are completely hidden from external parties.
  - To enforce the payments, commitments needs to be publicly opened after the corresponding block has been added to the blockchain, such that it can be publicly verified whether the commitment has been fulfilled or violated.
    - in case the commitment is fulfilled, the provider has to publicly open the commitment to get paid the bid amount
    - if the commitment is violated, the bidder has to publicly open it to receive the compensation from the provider.
  - In a nutshell, when providers publicly open a commitment, they now have to prove in zero-knowledge that the corresponding bidder could also have opened it. This prevents griefing attacks in which a malicious provider issues invalid commitments that cannot be opened by the bidder, but could still be opened by the provider.

## Protocol

- [A local-node-favoring delta to the scaling roadmap](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-local-node-favoring-delta-to-the-scaling-roadmap/22368/1)
  ![](https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/6/5/65e830fde9112642eb74f76377116aa9740129a6.png)
  - partially stateless nodes
  - The node is capable of responding to RPC requests as long as the required data is within that subset of the state
  - other requests will fail (or have to fallback to an externally-hosted cryptographic solution; whether or not to do this should be the user’s choice).

- [Delayed Execution and Free DA](https://ethresear.ch/t/delayed-execution-and-free-da/22265)
  - why do we need delayed execution
    - Give zkVM provers more time
    - Give validators more time
  - Free DA
    - Under delayed execution, a transaction might appear valid at proposal time but fail later (e.g., sender's balance is drained earlier in the block).
      To keep fork-choice complexity low, we need designs that keep blocks valid even if some txs are invalid.
  - 4 design variants
    - Optimistic Attesting
    - Upfront Validation + Pre-charging
    - Pre-charging Coinbase
    - Payload No-op
- [A maximally simple L1 privacy roadmap](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-maximally-simple-l1-privacy-roadmap/23459)
  - Privacy of onchain payments

  - Privacy of reads to the chain, ie. RPC calls
  - Network-levelExecution Dependencies anonymization
- [Fast Confirmation Rule on Safe Head in Prysm](https://ethresear.ch/t/fast-confirmation-rule-on-safe-head-in-prysm/22167)
  - Safe block allows consumers of chain to safely make forward progress without needing to wait for finality which takes longer to achieve.
- [Long-term L1 execution layer proposal: replace the EVM with RISC-V](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/long-term-l1-execution-layer-proposal-replace-the-evm-with-risc-v/23617)
  - replacing the ZK-EVM with RISC-V solves a key bottleneck
    - witness size: Replace the current keccak 16-ary Merkle patricia tree with a binary tree that uses a prover-friendly hash function
    - block execution: ZK-EVM provers today already work by proving over implementations of the EVM compiled down to RISC-V, and give smart contract developers access to that RISC-V VM directly.

- [Does Your Blockchain Need Multidimensional Transaction Fees?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15438)
  - Multidimensional fees aren’t always worth the extra UX and protocol overhead.
  - To achieve maximal performance, pack as many transactions as you can so that the total amount of each resource consumed is below its limit. Formally, this is a multi-dimensional knapsack.
    ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GpOfkMMWQAAyBXF?format=jpg&name=medium)
  - We explore how to compress n resources into k-dimensional fees (e.g., gas + blob). We study two approaches:
    — Partitioning: group resources into k different sets; we show this is NP-complete
    — Factorization: factorize the usage matrix into k “factors”: we show this is a non-standard Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) problem

- [Fee structure for EXECUTE-precompile](https://ethresear.ch/t/fee-structure-for-execute-precompile/22096)
  - The EXECUTE-precompile is a theoretical feature on Ethereum’s roadmap that lets validators directly re-execute a rollup’s EVM logic at L1. This mechanism would offer “native” Ethereum security, eliminating the need for complex fraud proofs or specialized zk-verifiers.
  - However, if it’s only invoked during controversies, rollups could avoid paying meaningful fees most of the time.
  - By requiring upfront registration and continuous verification through the FDC-contract, rollups have no choice but to pay for the robust security Ethereum provides.

  - The Orbit path: Embarking on a more costly R&D programme in order to preserve maximally free entry of solo stakers in the validator set; or
  - The capped validator set path: Relying much more heavily on the sufficiency of home operators to guarantee properties such as censorship-resistance.
  - Two versions of FOCIL:
    - Heavy FOCIL: Includers are sampled from the validator set.
    - Light FOCIL: Includers are sampled from an operator set curated by ETH holders, distinct from the validator set.

## Others

- [Merkle Mountain Ranges for Performant Data Authentication](https://commonware.xyz/blogs/mmr.html)
  - A MMR differs from a Merkle tree in that it is append-only. While Merkle trees support element updates and insertions at arbitrary list positions, MMRs only allow new elements to be added to the end of the list.
    ![](https://commonware.xyz/imgs/mmr.png)
  - The append-only restriction may appear burdensome, but it turns out updates can still be simulated through re-appending data (as in QMDB). What this restriction yields, however, is extreme performance. When adding an element to the MMR, (1) very little data needs to be read in from storage (typically cached), and (2) new data generated by the addition can be persisted to storage with one contiguous write. Contrast this to a standard Merkle tree, where adding or updating an element can require reading and updating a logarithmically sized amount of data scattered randomly across storage.

  - [What happened?](https://x.com/0x94305/status/1907935535785762828)
    - Normally solvers can't include new orders in their solutions to count towards the overall surplus - but CoW AMM is an exception.
    - So to win, Quasilabs created a CoW AMM order that sold 12 ETH for 3.4K USDC.
    - Why did they choose to pay the AMM rather than return more to the user?
      - incentives to use the pool. Or maybe they are LPing in it. Or maybe they just like the AMM.

    - By forcing a single winner per auction, a batch auction may artificially discard valid solutions that could have been executed in parallel to the winning one, therefore limiting the protocol’s throughput
    - It is liable to “surplus shifting”, that is, the possibility that the benefit of batching multiple trades together accrues disproportionately to some of these trades.

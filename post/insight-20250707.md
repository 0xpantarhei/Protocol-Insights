  ![](https://i.imgur.com/zESn9BO.png)

  - Rather than encoding transactions as static tuples, developers can author dynamic, conditional, and composable execution scripts.
  - Scripts are authored in TypeScript, using abstractions over on-chain functions. The result is compiled to verifiable, Merkle-hashed bytecode that can be signed and executed by relayers.
  - This flow used to require a custom contract. Now it’s a script that can be authored, tested, and pushed without any on-chain deployment.
  - Developers can simulate the flow with testnets or mainnet forking before execution.
  - ```
    import { runtimeERC20BalanceOf } from "@biconomy/abstractjs";
    import { balanceNotZeroConstraint } from "../utils/balanceNotZero.util";
    const swapInstruction = await oNexus.buildComposable({
      type: "default",
      data: {
        chainId: optimism.id,
        to: "0xProtocolAddress",
        abi: protocolAbi,
        functionName: "swap",
        args: [
          runtimeERC20BalanceOf({
            tokenAddress: "0xTokenAddress",
            targetAddress: nexusAddress,
            constraints: [balanceNotZeroConstraint]
          })
        ]
      }
    });
    ```

- [Awesome EIP-7702 Delegations](https://github.com/Arvolear/awesome-eip-7702-delegations?tab=readme-ov-file)
- Note that with Entrypoint v0.8, you can't alter the delegate the UserOp wants to use: the signature is forced to include the right delegate, making the UserOp invalid in case there is a different one.
  - This also means that a UserOp that attempts to modify the delegate will fail if a bundler tries to strip off the new authorization, and submit the UserOp with the old delegate...

- [ERC-7786: The Crosschain Messaging Gateway](https://www.erc7786.org/)
  - The vision of this proposal is to standardize a common interface decentralized applications (dApps) can use to securely send and receive messages across multiple blockchains. By encoding a standard set of functions, developers would be able to access any compliant crosschain messaging protocol.
  - OpenBridge allows to protect high-value transfers by requiring confirmations from multiple messaging protocols for max security

  - Current challenges of interoperability between Ethereum L2s
    - limited liquidity
    - a small number of dominant fillers
  - The core idea behind Filler Vaults is to allow fillers to compete solely based on the quality of their strategies, while capital is supplied by decentralized liquidity vaults.

## Block Pipeline

- [How upcoming EIPs affect preconfirmations](https://ethresear.ch/t/future-proofing-preconfirmations/22618)

  - Inclusion Lists

    - Compatibility: Both proposers and includers can offer inclusion preconfirmations, but actual execution of preconfirmations must still be controlled by the proposer.
    - Incentives and Penalties: Reduced block space may lower preconfirmation tip revenue; preconfirmations issued by includers may crowd out censorship-resistant transactions.

  - Multi-Concurrent Proposers (MCP)

    - Compatibility: Preconfirmations are still possible, but executing them requires a well-defined sub-block ordering scheme.
    - Conflict Risk: Preconfirmations from multiple proposers for the same transaction may cause tip allocation disputes.

  - Altruistic Proposer Separation (APS)
    - Compatibility: Proposer election timing affects how early preconfirmations can be issued; executing preconfirmations requires proposers to be identified in advance.
    - Incentives and Penalties: Mechanisms need to adapt to dynamic proposer selection processes (e.g., auctions or ticketing systems).

- [Two rounds of voting will not against shortern slot times](https://x.com/potuz_eth/status/1936146328658088332)
  - The PTC vote happens during another useful part of the slot and doesn't delay it at all
  - The only extra latency that ePBS ads in protocol is the time to reveal that the builder takes to be sure of not being unbundled
- [MEV has become the dominant limit to scaling blockchains](https://x.com/hasufl/status/1934659665822142500)
  ![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GtlKwGFa0AIDGqZ?format=png&name=medium)
  - Spam bots across multiple rollups and Solana consume >50% of gas and pay <10% of fees.
  - L2s are scaling quickly in terms of capacity, but spam eats up most of the benefit
  - Spam bots' constant demand for gas creates persistently higher fees for users
  - Example

- [Slot Restructuring: Design Considerations and Trade-Offs](https://ethresear.ch/t/slot-restructuring-design-considerations-and-trade-offs/22687)
  - Pick EIP‑7886 for Glamsterdam: its EL-side version gives ~80 % of ePBS’s slot‑pipelining throughput without ePBS’s extra moving parts.
  - Keep it simple: no beacon‑/payload split, no PTC committee and zero fork‑choice changes.
  - Big wins, low risk: we still unlock major L1 scaling headroom and leave today’s MEV‑Boost flow untouched.
  - Future‑proof: if we ever need the last 20 % of pipelining (or trustless payments), we can cleanly layer full ePBS on top later.
- [Slot timings and ePBS](https://hackmd.io/@potuz/B1pWLb0-ll)
  - EIP-7886 (Delayed Execution)
    - No need for full execution layer (EL) verification — saves time.
      - Attestation Deadline: Reduced to ~2.2 seconds (consensus layer (CL) execution + partial EL execution).
      - Total Slot Time: Around 4.2 seconds (still requires full block and blob propagation).
  - EIP-7732 (ePBS)
    - Decouples the broadcasting of consensus layer (CL) blocks from execution layer (EL) data: - Only the CL block needs to be propagated (smaller size — experiments show <300 ms). - Attestation Deadline can be reduced to 1 second (requires only CL execution). - Additional Steps:
      - Payload Reveal: Builder must reveal the payload within 1 second after the attestation deadline.
      - PTC Watcher Mechanism: Requires an additional 3 seconds (payload propagation + 512 validator attestations).
  - Total Slot Time: About 5 seconds, but more efficient overall (hot path optimized, enables more parallelism).
- [BuilderNet is the best place to send your blobs](https://x.com/Data_Always/status/1941279852428132619)
  ![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GvDPphqXoAA5INY?format=jpg&name=medium)
  - Sometimes centralized builders get latency sensitive transactions and drop all blobs to speed up their pipelines.
  - It's literally impossible for BuilderNet operators to do that; the highest paying blobs will always be included.
- ERCs to significantly improve ethereum UX in next few months (simplified)
  - 5792: batch multiple clicks into one
  - 7811: apps can better view your assets, fewer prompts
  - 7828 + 7930: interoperable addresses for seamless crosschain sends (alice.eth@l2-name)

## Protocol

- [Fusaka EIPs](https://x.com/eth_everstake/status/1933186953458938116)
  - Devnet-1
    - EIP-7594: PeerDAS - trustless data availability sampling.
    - EIP-7823 & 7883: ModExp gas safety + cost adjustments.
    - EIP-7825: Transaction gas limit cap.
    - EIP-7892: Enables blob-only forks.
    - EIP-7917: Deterministic proposer lookahead.
    - EIP-7918: Blob base fee tied to execution gas.
    - EIP-7935: Sets default block gas limit (informational).
  - Devnet-x

    - EIP-7907: Tracks + raises contract code size limits.
    - EIP-7934: Limits RLP execution block size (for decoding safety).
- [Only 2% of validators have undergone stake consolidation](https://x.com/0xNatalie860/status/1936599519476744602)

  - The APR increase brought by stake consolidation is very limited
  - For validators with stakes below 1700 ETH, the APR may even slightly decrease
  - Once consolidated stakes are penalized, the losses are less controllable, and risk volatility increases.

- [EIP-7782: The case for 2x shorter slot times in Glamsterdam](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-7782-the-case-for-2x-shorter-slot-times-in-glamsterdam/24616?u=barnabe)
  - Change block proposal subslot from 4 seconds to 3 seconds.
  - Change attestation proposal subslot duration from 4 seconds to 1.5 seconds.
  - Change aggregation proposal subslot duration from 4 seconds to 1.5 seconds.
  - Why
    - Users on L1 have reduced transaction inclusion latency and better UX, with improved censorship-resistance from having more proposers per second,
    - Apps enjoy more frequent triggers, leading to reduced staleness of onchain data, and relatively less value leaking away from users, i.e., lower fees, as a result,
    - Block construction markets (builders, and in the future provers) offer more frequent opportunities to compete for smaller chunks of work, leading to healthier markets,
    - Interoperability protocols receive L1 finality quicker, as well as quicker confirmations,
    - Stakers have lower reward variability, reducing incentives to pool for the purpose of reducing risk,
    - Node operators receive improved load management, in particular bandwidth, as smaller blocks are disseminated more frequently, lowering resource peaks.
  - Security & Open Questions
    - The primary risk of shortening slot times is raising the bar for effective participation in the validator set
    - If gas or blob throughput is to be increased, this would require independent research and engineering efforts, regardless of slot time.
    - Contract Compatibility Needs Assessment
    - Further Slot Time Reductions Require Consensus Mechanism Changes

- [What is important for Ethereum to win](https://x.com/gakonst/status/1935659248886681825)

  - decouple validation from block building throughout with zk
  - decouple censorship resistance from weakest node

- [On the future of the blob mempool](https://ethresear.ch/t/on-the-future-of-the-blob-mempool/22613)
  ![](https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/3/d/3d1d9ed1f121f0ec138ee0dd1810d8a1ca2987c7.png)

  - PeerDAS introduces a fundamental asymmetry between the EL and the CL.
  - The obviously “correct” solution is to shard the blobpool vertically, mirroring the vertical sharding of the DA check
  - In other words, we need a blobpool-native way to gossip blob columns instead of only full blobs to allow nodes to download the data they are responsible for in their DA check. The figure below demonstrates this.
  - DoS attacks are the limiting factor when considering the vertically sharded blobpool.
    - How can we be sure that the columns gossiped belong to a fee-paying transaction?
    - Under this model, any column that is gossiped must come from an identity that has paid for the ability to write that data to the blobpool during that slot.

- [A new design for DAS and Sharded Blob Mempools](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-new-design-for-das-and-sharded-blob-mempools/22537)
  - Current Shortcomings
    - Validator nodes that want to build/propose blocks have to download all blobs into their mempool.
    - The block builder/proposer needs to disseminate (i.e., upload) all the erasure-coded blob data (128MB) when producing a block.
    - Blobs are propagated over both the EL and the CL (as rows), leading to redundancy and bandwidth waste.
    - Entire rows and columns are disseminated over the network
  - New design
    - A shared mempool by node ID
    - CL nodes need to custody (i.e., store) a number of rows and columns from the EC-extended block.
      - the rows the CL has to custody, should be the same blobs that the EL should download into their mempool
      - instead of sending entire columns (unless it is a supernode), nodes disseminate partial columns over Gossipsub topics.

- [EVM 2.0 - Proving-Centric vs. Execution-Centric Approaches](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/evm-2-0-proving-centric-vs-execution-centric-approaches/24455)
  - Prioritizing fast execution and a standard toolchain at the expense of fast ZK proving,
  - Prioritizing fast proving at the expense of execution and standard toolchain, and
  - A 2-step approach that passes through a blockchain-friendly VM followed by a ZK-VM, also at the expense of standard toolchain (though not necessarily fast execution).
- [60M Gas Limit on Sepolia & Hoodi](https://ethpandaops.io/posts/60m-gas-sepolia-hoodi/)
  - Based on the data from Hoodi & Sepolia, 60M is safe as far as block/blob propagation is concerned.

  ![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GseSaXOb0AYwUIW?format=png&name=medium)
- [Empirical blob sidecar hit rate based on local EL’s mempool](https://ethresear.ch/t/empirical-blob-sidecar-hit-rate-based-on-local-els-mempool/22475)
  - Monitoring the local engine_GetBlobsV1 calls between the CL and the EL shows a high empirical blob hit-rate at the EL’s mempool:
    - 76.6% of the total requests were successfully retrieved from the local EL mempool to validate the block in under 100ms.
    - -The remaining 23.4% of the requests were partially responded to. However, in the majority of these partial responses (98%), only a single blob sidecar was missing from the requested list.
  - Current network status shows that redistributing all sidecars over the gossipsub network might generate some redundant traffic, as currently, the majority of blobs are already present at the EL mempool by the time a new block is broadcast.
- [On incentivizing anonymous participation](https://ethresear.ch/t/on-incentivizing-anonymous-participation/22469)
  - Protocols want to attract participation in some form and use incentives to elicit it:
    - Proof-of-Work offers block rewards to incentivize miners to solve cryptographic puzzles.
    - Proof-of-Stake offers consensus rewards for staking and voting correctly on blocks.
    - Prover markets coordinate the production of computationally intensive ZK proofs.
- [Attestation Arrival Timing on Ethereum Mainnet](https://hackmd.io/@tchain/att-arrival-timing)
  - 50% of attestations arrive within 1s in most slots
  - 66% is also usually reached under 1s
  - 80%+ starts showing a longer tail, with arrivals stretching to 5-6s
- [A practical proposal for Multidimensional Gas Metering](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-practical-proposal-for-multidimensional-gas-metering/22668)
  - Allows to increase block capacity, without changing the block gas limit and without complicating UX.
  - The block.gas_target and block.gas_limit stay unchanged, 18m and 36m respectively.
  - Suppose we get a block where the demand profile for each resource, measured in million gas units, is (18, 9, 9, 6, 3), where each dimension in the vector is the gas attributed to a single resource.
  - This block would be invalid under the current specification since sum(18, 9, 9, 6, 3) = 45 exceeds the gas limit by 9 million gas units.
  - With the new proposal the gas metered is max(18, 9, 9, 6, 3) = 18 which makes the block valid and also right at target, so the gas fee will not change.
  - Suppose we then get a block with high load on the second resource (18, 30, 9, 6, 3), block.gas_metered = 30 million gas units. While still being a valid block since it is bellow the limit, the base fee will increase as it is above the target.

- [The paths of least resistance: Introducing WFR-Gossip](https://ethresear.ch/t/the-paths-of-least-resistance-introducing-wfr-gossip/22671)

  - Classic Gossipsub floods the network with many duplicates, wasting bandwidth.
  - Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao (WFR) Gossip addresses this by treating propagation as an optimal-transport problem: nodes forward messages preferentially along lower-latency links.

    - Each node uses a simple rule:
      - Forward to a few low-latency peers (D₍robust₎ ≈ 3)
      - For others, forward only if RTT_out < RTT_in

  - In simulations with 10,000 nodes, WFR-Gossip reduced bandwidth usage by ~50% and improved latency by 40%, maintaining over 95% network coverage.

- [Alternative DAS concept based on RLNC](https://ethresear.ch/t/alternative-das-concept-based-on-rlnc/22651)
  - The present DAS approach for Ethereum is based on Reed-Solomon erasure coding + KZG commitments.
  - The novel scheme (described here Faster block/blob propagation in Ethereum by @potuz) introduces another pair: RLNC (Random Linear Network Coding) erasure coding + Pedersen commitments. It has nice properties which could be used to consider an alternative Data Availability approach.
  - Advantages
    - Storage Optimization: Nodes only need to store a fraction of the data (e.g., ~3% when S=32), significantly reducing hardware requirements.
    - Flexible Recovery: Any SS honest nodes can reconstruct the full data, without relying on a specific subnet structure.
    - Potential Transmission Optimization: RLNC can reduce redundant transmission and may be compatible with Ethereum’s blob mempool (engine_getBlobs).
- [Impact of IDONTWANT in the n umber of duplicates](https://ethresear.ch/t/impact-of-idontwant-in-the-number-of-duplicates/22652)
  - Specifically, the proportion of messages with no duplicates increased from 2% to 9%, the average number of duplicates decreased from 3 to 2, extreme duplication cases (e.g., 34–40 duplicates) dropped to 6–8 occurrences, and 98% of duplicate messages arrived within 1 second.
  - However, the effectiveness of IDONTWANT has not fully met expectations. The study found that 70% of duplicate messages came from peers that had already received an IDONTWANT, mainly because the messages were already in transit and could not be canceled (e.g., due to implementation limitations in Rust-libp2p).

- [Blob Sharing for Based Rollups](https://ethresear.ch/t/blob-sharing-for-based-rollups/22659)

  - There is a key architectural feature of based rollups: the presence of a natural “shared proposer.”
  - This shared proposer not only enables intra-slot proposal aggregation but also allows us to aggregate multiple proposals from different rollup inboxes into a single set of blobs within a single transaction, thus allowing for a blob to fill up with proposals across multiple based rollup inboxes.
  - Approach
    - Shared Proposer as the Blob Aggregator
    - EIP-7702 for One-Tx Fan-out
      - The shared proposer can use this to load a tiny batcher contract, which calls every rollup inbox and passes the needed metadata in one L1 transaction

- [Atomic Cross-Rollup Arbitrage via Coordinator and State Lock Auctions](https://collective.flashbots.net/t/atomic-cross-rollup-arbitrage-via-coordinator-and-state-lock-auctions/4993)
  - The coordinator runs a state lock auction mechanism, allowing searchers (e.g., MEV bots) to bid for exclusive access rights to specific state regions (e.g., a Uniswap pool) on both Rollups;
  - The winning bidder’s transactions are inserted atomically by the sequencers of both Rollups into their respective blocks, ensuring they either both execute or both fail, eliminating partial execution risk;
  - Each transaction uses an EIP-2930 access list to explicitly declare the addresses and storage slots it will access, enabling the coordinator and builders to precisely lock state and prevent conflicts or re-entrancy;
  - To protect transaction privacy, the design incorporates a TEE (Trusted Execution Environment): searchers submit transactions into the TEE, which reveals only the access list for auction purposes, without disclosing full transaction details.

  - A large part of reducing friction from adverse selection is ensuring that the market maker wins this race as often as possible.
    - As soon as the fair moves outside of the bid ask spread, a race begins.
    - The market maker tries to cancel their order as fast as possible
    - takers try to snipe the stale order before the market maker can cancel it.
  - Data from a centralized exchange shows that, after a jump, market makers win the race to cancel just 13% of the time.
  - Market makers on centralized exchanges don’t win the race to cancel that often but market makers on Solana win the cancel race even less of the time.
    - Even if the market maker is faster, what really matters for who wins the cancel race is who pays the highest bid in the Jito auction.

    ![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gtze5EbX0AAXUJ2?format=jpg&name=large)
    - Pre-position inventory on chains -> fast-execution, but ties up capital & exposes to price swings
    - Send funds via a bridge → cheaper & simpler upfront, but the transfer lag can kill the trade.
  - Key factors: If opportunities arrive fast enough, keep inventory
    - Opportunity frequency
    - Bridging duration
    - Token value drift
  - Execution: Inventory vs Bridge
    - 67 % of arbitrages pre-position inventory (no bridge needed).
    - The remaining 33 % bridge assets:
      - 72 % via third-party multi-chain bridges
      - 28 % via native L1↔L2 bridges

  - Breaks common input heuristic: Breaks Satoshi's assumption that all inputs come from the sender.
  - Hurts change identification: Makes it harder to determine which output is payment and which is change.
  - Eliminates standalone consolidations: Receivers consolidate in a batch with their payments, making it cheaper to break the heuristics than leak info.
  - Improves global privacy: Payjoins can look like non-payjoins, compounding difficulty for surveillance adversaries.
  - Probing Attack
    - Probing entails an attacker initiating payjoins they plan to abort in order to learn about the coins in a receiver's wallet.

  - The liquidity providooor opens up a 90% LTV Looped position (assuming with PT tokens) on AAVE and splits the debt between USDC and USDT.
  - Anyone who wishes to swap simply repays part of the debt in USDC and borrows more in USDT (or vice versa)
  - This way, with $100k principal a LP can:
    - Get interest on up to $1m PT tokens (and pay fees on $900k debt)
    - Get LP fees on $900k worth of stables.

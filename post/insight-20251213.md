## Account Abstraction

- [Ethereum Interoperability Layer](https://docs.ethereuminteroplayer.com/index.html)
  ![](https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/b/5/b5d1c032add426359b2de8266a027616307d1220_2_1348x1000.png)

  - Why not intent?
    - Less censorship resistance
      - Transacting through intermediaries.
    - Less security
      - Trusting 3rd parties with funds or state attestation.
    - Less privacy
      - Exposing the user’s IP address and/or intention to 3rd parties.
    - Less open source
      - Most logic runs on a 3rd party server, often opaque to users.

- [Introducing MetaMask Social login](https://support.metamask.io/configure/wallet/social-login)
  - Threshold Oblivious Pseudorandom Function
  - How it works?
  - When the SRP is backed up, it is stored in MetaMask's backend as encrypted ciphertext
  - The encryption key is split across multiple key share holders using Shamir Secret Sharing (SSS)
  - No single party (not MetaMask, not the data store, not Google or Apple), other than you, can reconstruct the SRP in plaintext
  - The SRP is obtained in a 2/2 setup: by authenticating with the selected login provider (Google or Apple), and supplying the correct password
- [Rhinestone expanded SDK to the ENTIRE smart account stack, w/ intents as a shoo-in over ERC4337](https://x.com/rhinestonewtf/status/1965421747874021863?s=20)
  ![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G0aUnSGbgAk-Kzf?format=png&name=medium)

  - Why
    - Only a few smart account modules have become mainstays.
    - Intents ate the world, and will soon be the de-facto transaction layer for smart accounts.
    - Wallets now need to be crosschain-first.

- [Scaling Access for Multi-Chain Smart Accounts](https://www.stackup.fi/resources/stackup-keystore)
  - Stackup Keystore is a permissionless protocol that enables smart contract wallets to enforce access control across chains privately and cheaply.
  - Challenges
    - Problem 1: Awkward key rotations and cross chain deployments

- [Workshop - Future-Proofing EOAs: Free EIP-7702 Infra Integration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTjdV1_Eb-Y)
  - The presenters confirmed that the Ethereum Foundation’s EIP-7702 infrastructure is free to use, publicly accessible, open-source, requires no API keys, and is built on top of the EntryPoint v0.9 shared mempool, which provides distribution across multiple bundlers to avoid single points of failure. The infrastructure is currently live on Ethereum mainnet, Optimism, and Arbitrum, with support for additional networks planned.

- [Introducing Warp, a blazing-fast intent routing and execution engine with built-in account abstraction. Build multi-chain apps with seamless UX at warp speed.](https://www.rhinestone.dev/blog/go-multi-chain-at-warp-speed)
  - Warp” aggregates settlement layers through a unified relayer market and uses on-chain adapters to support multiple bridges and formats. An Intent Router dispatches operations, while optional resource locks via Uniswap’s “The Compact” enable optimistic fills on the destination chain before origin-side claims finalize, helping keep outcomes atomic and near-instant without opaque calldata.

## Block Pipeline

- [Parallel Auctions on Commit-Boost](https://ethresear.ch/t/parallel-auctions-on-commit-boost/22955)
  - Current inclusion-based commitments fail to guarantee execution consistency, leading searchers to adopt risk-averse strategies that reduce market efficiency.
  - A dual-component approach
    - Exclusion Commitment
    - Inclusion Commitment
  - The architecture includes a Gateway (for proposers) and a LockEngine (for builders), enabling proposers to auction exclusive state rights, prevent conflicts, increase revenue, and foster a more robust and efficient MEV market.
- [The Free Option Problem in ePBS](https://collective.flashbots.net/t/the-free-option-problem-in-epbs/5115/1)
  - a builder that commits to an execution payload and wins the block auction, can wait to invalidate the execution payload until shortly before the payload timeliness committee (PTC) deadline (for the details see below). In case new information arrives after the commitment but before the PTC deadline and that information makes it preferable to publish an empty block rather than publishing the block committed to, the builder can choose to do so.

## Protocol

- [Ethereum (Roadmap) in 30min by Vitalik Buterin - Devconnect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWvThjrjTmw)

  - The roadmap for 2025–2026 centers on scalability.
    - Vitalik noted that Ethereum’s gas limit has already increased by 50% this year and may reach 60 million as validator voting progresses.
    - Key upgrades include EIP-7732 (enshrined proposer-builder separation) and block-level access lists, which allow all non-producing nodes to process blocks in parallel.
  - Looking to 2026–2027, Buterin described upgrades focused on censorship resistance, stronger account abstraction, improved wallet security, better light clients, and enhanced privacy

- [LMD GHOST with ~256 validators and a fast-following finality gadget](https://ethresear.ch/t/lmd-ghost-with-256-validators-and-a-fast-following-finality-gadget/22856)
  - The optimal approach to re-architecting the slot structure to reduce the number of network latency rounds in one slot may be to move somewhat away from the tight coupling between slots and finality introduced in 3SF, and instead have a more separate LMD GHOST fork choice rule and finality gadget, with different participant counts.
  - proposal - Have an LMD GHOST chain where ~256 validators are randomly selected per slot. Use this as the primary “heartbeat”
  - Have a finalizing consensus mechanism trail closely behind (realistically, finalize in perhaps 12 δ), that uses all the active validators. Don’t try to couple LMD GHOST votes and finalizing consensus votes; treat them as fully separate.
- [A Fast Confirmation Rule (aka Fast Synchronous Finality) for the Ethereum Consensus Protocol](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00549)
  - Casper: asynchronous but 13-19 min
  - This paper: 12-30 s but synchrony
- [Lean Consensus R&D Progress](https://leanroadmap.org/)

- [EIP-2780: Reduce intrinsic transaction gas](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2780)

  - Reduce intrinsic transaction gas and charge 25k when a value transfer creates a new account
  - Reduce the intrinsic cost TX_BASE_COST from 21,000 to 4,500 and define a consistent gas accounting model based on actual state operations. This more granular approach makes a simple ETH transfer 6,000 from additional costs related to the to account.
  - If a non-create transaction has value > 0 and targets a non-existent account, charge GAS_NEW_ACCOUNT = 25,000 to align with CALL account creation and price in state growth. When this surcharge applies, the recipient pays exactly one cold non-code touch; no code-load cost applies.

- [BETH](https://x.com/binji_x/status/1962103556317556960?s=20)
  - ![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GzrKyOoW0AAtYme?format=jpg&name=medium)
- [An analysis of attestation timings in a 6-s slot](https://ethresear.ch/t/an-analysis-of-attestation-timings-in-a-6-s-slot/23016/1)
  - It aims to assess the feasibility of EIP-7782, which proposes reducing the slot to 6 seconds by setting the attestation deadline to 3 seconds and the aggregation deadline to 4.5 seconds.
- [3-Slot-Finality Protocol for Ethereum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00558)
  - To address these issues and speed up finality, we introduce a partially synchronous finality gadget, which we combine with two dynamically available consensus protocols -- synchronous protocols that ensure safety and liveness even with fluctuating validator participation levels.
  - This integration results in secure ebb-and-flow protocols, achieving finality within three slots after a proposal and realizing 3-slot finality.
- [PSE Roadmap: 2025 and Beyond](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/pse-roadmap-2025-and-beyond/25423)
  - Private writes
    - Make private onchain actions as cheap and seamless as public ones.
  - Private reads
    - nable reads from Ethereum without revealing identity or intent.
  - Private proving
    - Make proving any data private and accessible.
- [Fusaka Mainnet Announcement](https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/11/06/fusaka-mainnet-announcement)
  - EIP-7594: PeerDAS - Peer Data Availability Sampling

- [Not All State is Equal](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/not-all-state-is-equal/25508)
  - a few contracts hold most storage, while most accounts are short-lived—sometimes only a single block
- [ERC-7806: Minimal intent-centric EOA smart account](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7806)
  ![](https://etherspot.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/aa_diget_7086.png)
  - This proposal defines a standard interface for intent-centric smart accounts. It enables externally owned accounts (EOAs) to delegate contract code to a smart account implementation, allowing them to sign intents. These intents can then be executed by solvers (or relayers) on behalf of the account owner, streamlining interactions and expanding the capabilities of EOAs.
- [Circle Gateway: Redefining Crosschain UX with a Unified USDC Balance](https://www.circle.com/blog/circle-gateway-redefining-crosschain-ux)
  ![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67116d0daddc92483c812ead/68a32fbf1fe47770d6af7209_gateway-diagram.jpg)
  - Fragmented liquidity, varying transaction costs, and inconsistent settlement times create operational bottlenecks that slow growth and degrade UX. Payment service providers, exchanges, and crosschain infrastructure teams are often still forced to pre-position USDC across multiple chains, maintain chain-specific balances, and deal with overfunding, complexity, and execution delays—resulting in suboptimal capital efficiency.
  - Circle Gateway, now live on mainnet, is designed to solve these challenges. Gateway redefines crosschain UX by combining smart contract infrastructure with an offchain attestation service to enable a unified USDC balance instantly accessible crosschain in <500 ms. This improved capital efficiency and instant availability bolsters USDC utility as a powerful crosschain asset.
- [EIP-7594: PeerDAS - Peer Data Availability Sampling](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7594)
  ![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*LpdTXwQhNVI2YwJCS_FUTQ.png)
  ![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*h-XVYiJ3cfQxsqvZcsLzEg.png)
  - With PeerDAS, extended blob data is divided into 128 pieces called columns. Data is distributed to these nodes via a dedicated gossip protocol on specific subnets that they subscribe to. Each regular node on the network participates in at least 8 randomly chosen column subnets. Receiving data from only 8 of 128 subnets means that this default node receives only 1/16 of all data, but because the data was extended this is 1/8th of the original data.
  - Column sampling vs row sampling
    - Column sampling is based on data slices that naturally exist in the network, so it does not require constructing new data during block production. Row sampling, on the other hand, forces the block producer to generate additional extension blobs, increasing the load on the critical path and making it impractical in real-world engineering.
      - Column slices naturally exist in the network, while row slices require extension data to be constructed during block production — which is too heavy.
      - Nodes are much more likely to already possess full blobs, making reconstruction from columns simpler.
      - Row extensions can be done ahead of time, while column extensions must be computed during block production — making column sampling more efficient.

- [Gossipsub’s Partial Messages Extension and Cell Level dissemination](https://ethresear.ch/t/gossipsubs-partial-messages-extension-and-cell-level-dissemination/23017)
  - In PeerDAS, the erasure-coded blobs included in a block are propagated across the network as columns (DataColumnSidecars).
    - If a node already has some blobs in its local mempool, it can assemble the corresponding columns directly without waiting for them to propagate over the network.
    - But if even one blob is missing, the node must wait for the entire column to arrive, which introduces latency.
    - Partial Message Extension is designed specifically to address this bottleneck. It allows nodes to send and request only the missing cells within a column, rather than redundantly transmitting the entire column, thereby improving propagation efficiency.

## Rollup

- [Why are based rollups the only future of Ethereum?](https://research.hazeflow.xyz/p/why-are-based-rollups-the-only-future)

  - Every rollup today runs its own centralized sequencer, the system that decides the order of transactions in a block, who gets in first, and also who captures profits from MEV.
  - Because each sequencer operates independently, rollups run on different timelines. Apps on separate rollups can’t interact atomically, in the same block at the same time, which fractures liquidity and weakens composability.
  - [Fabric Ethereum](https://x.com/fabric_ethereum) is the coordination effort to build standard for based rollups. It doesn’t launch a rollup or token. Instead, it delivers minimal open-source components, including:
    - Commitments API for pre-confs
    - Universal Registry Contract for sequencer accountability
    - Shared blob and bridging infrastructure

- [Optimism is partnering with Flashbots to bring fast, verifiable sequencing to the Superchain](https://x.com/Optimism/status/1958515057043599465?s=20)
  - Configurable sequencing lets builders design chains their way: faster, cheaper, and more flexible.
  - Features

  - without a shared, standard way to touch each other’s state, cross chain UX devolves into async messages, relays
  - inside ULTRA TX, we can: bundle AA meta txs, compose across L2s, share blob space, and aggregate proofs, as a single atomic program

- [ERC-8004: Trustless Agents](https://x.com/eth_everstake/status/1958558213625819393?s=19)
  - <https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8004>
  - The existing Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol works, but only within trusted org boundaries.
  - ERC-8004 extends A2A with a trust layer, enabling agents from different ecosystems to discover and interact securely. Developers can choose from three trust models: reputation systems using client feedback, validation via stake-secured re-execution, zkML proofs, or TEE oracles.
  - The standard introduces 3 onchain registries:
    - Identity - portable, censorship-resistant agent IDs.
    - Reputation - attestations with flexible off-chain scoring.
    - Validation - generic hooks for economic or cryptographic verification.
- [Succinct Private Proving](https://x.com/SuccinctLabs/status/1975989782200320231)
  - Previously, proofs on the Succinct Prover Network were public. With Private Proving, developers can generate proofs inside a trusted execution environment (TEE).
  - Inputs stay encrypted and are decrypted inside a secure enclave. Neither provers nor the network can see them.
- [The Verifiable Cloud: How EigenCloud is Unlocking Crypto’s App and AI Era](https://members.delphidigital.io/reports/the-verifiable-cloud-how-eigencloud-is-unlocking-cryptos-app-and-ai-era/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=Eigencloud#key-takeaways)
  - While restaking can incentivize correct behavior through slashing, that is still probabilistic enforcement
  - restaking alone is powerful but incomplete, because it scales validator participation without resolving how arbitrary computation can be made provably correct.
  - EigenCloud was precisely designed as the system to resolve this mismatch. It introduces a framework where AVSs can not only inherit Ethereum’s staked security but also tap into scalable, off-chain verifiability, subsequently turning EigenLayer closer to what could be interpreted as a complete trust model.
  - The suite is composed of three components:
    - EigenDA: Publishing and persisting data
    - EigenVerify: Adjudicating correctness
    - EigenCompute: Containerizing computation
  - A service might use EigenDA as its storage layer → call into an ML inference container on EigenCompute → pass the result through EigenVerify for objective adjudication.
  - Instead of treating verifiability as something only enforced at the final output, each service in the chain is checkpointed and subject to EigenLayer’s dispute/forking logic.

  - zkRollup for Bitcoin: requires publishing 144 bytes of anchoring data on-chain.
  - OP_RETURN only allows 83 bytes — not enough.
  - Witness data cannot be referenced.
  - The current workaround creates two UTXOs that will exist forever:

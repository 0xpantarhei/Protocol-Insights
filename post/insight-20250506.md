## Account Abstraction

- [Coinbase EIP-7702 Proxy](https://github.com/base/eip-7702-proxy)
  - [Audit](https://cantina.xyz/competitions/b0a948cd-c861-4807-b36e-d680d82598bf)
- [ERC-5792 Updates](https://x.com/0xyoussea/status/1903132377712582942)
  - atomic & sequential capabilities
  - communicate capabilities and call (atomicity) status, but no error logs, between wallet and DApp
- [Explore Ethereum's evolution toward full account abstraction through ERC-5189, ERC-4337, RIP-7560, and EIP-7701 smart account models.](https://research.2077.xyz/charting-ethereums-account-abstraction-roadmap-iii-the-endgame)
- [Unpacking The Next Generation Of Ethereum L2s (V): Keystore Rollups](https://x.com/2077Research/status/1907542004441198822)
  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gnjvx52XcAA2FhK?format=jpg&name=medium)
  - The core issue is rollups’ isolated states, especially for account authentication (e.g., owner keys). While smart accounts enable features like key rotation and recovery, syncing state updates across networks remains tricky. There is no interoperability at the account level.
  - Keystore rollups address this by consolidating authentication, reducing expenses, and enhancing security through prompt updates. Leading efforts by Base, Scroll, Stackr Labs, and Security Labs (via Functor) advance this solution, despite challenges such as infrastructure demands and synchronization delays.

## Interop

- [Hard Truths of Interoperability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWGHhLJkEXE)

- [Blocknative Gas Network](https://x.com/mcutler/status/1894821310729199681)
  - The Gas Network is a decentralized network designed to bring accurate cross-chain gas estimation data on-chain.
  - By making quality cross-chain gas estimations available on-chain, the Gas Network helps users and protocols avoid overpaying or risking failed transactions due to underpaying transaction costs in cross-chain scenarios. This not only reduces costs and risks of cross chain transactions, but also enhances the user experience.

## Block Pipeline

- [FairFlow: A ‘Dutch Auction’ Variation of TimeBoost](https://x.com/Hyunxukee/status/1911783199086108789)
  - Proposed in 2023, TimeBoost is built on FCFS but adds an option to boost the transaction’s submission time based on an attached bid. This mechanism incentivizes time-sensitive participants, such as searchers, to pay more and thus works as an additional source of revenue for rollup. In the Arbitrum’s implementation, the winner of a periodic auction enjoys delay-free inclusion for the next minute, while transactions from the rest incur a 200 ms delay.
  - TimeBoost but with open auction for backrun opportunity, hosted by sequencer

- [A Taxonomy of Preconfirmation Guarantees and Their Slashing Conditions in Rollups](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-taxonomy-of-preconfirmation-guarantees-and-their-slashing-conditions-in-rollups/22130)
  - There are three essential guarantees to a preconfirmation:
    - Inclusion
    - Ordering
    - Execution success
  - Category 0
    - Inclusion is guaranteed. No guarantees on ordering or execution success.
    - Slashing Computation: O(n)
  - Category 1
    - Inclusion and ordering are guaranteed. Execution success is not guaranteed.
    - Slashing Computation: O(1)
  - Category 2
    - Inclusion and execution success are guaranteed. No guarantee on ordering.
    - Slashing Computation: O(n) + O(m)
- [An Anti-Collusion Mechanism for Threshold Encrypted Mempools](https://ethresear.ch/t/an-anti-collusion-mechanism-for-threshold-encrypted-mempools/22129)
  - Encrypted mempools are a promising approach to prevent the malicious extraction of maximal extractable value (MEV) in public blockchains such as Ethereum.
  - Threshold encryption is a good candidate to establish an encrypted mempool, but unfortunately crucially relies on the threshold trust assumption: the assumption that within a predefined set of parties (the threshold committee) at least a subset of these parties act honestly.
  - In this post, we explore an approach to establish a threshold encrypted mempool that remains secure even if all parties in the threshold committee collude.
  - Approach
    ![](https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/f/e/fe9be3ba808fd44f30257044c27533478ab79832_2_1380x746.jpeg)
    - The main idea of the anti-collusion mechanism is to make it technically infeasible for the Keypers to decrypt a ciphertext from the encrypted mempool before the block proposer has made a valid commitment to include the decrypted transaction at the top of the block.
    - This ensures that if a ciphertext is decrypted, the resulting transaction will be included into the next block or the proposer will be slashed.
    - If such a commitment does not exist, then the Keypers cannot decrypt the ciphertext.

- [EIP-7938: Exponential Gas Limit Increase](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7938)
  - The current gas limit mechanism relies on miner/operator voting, which lacks coordination and predictability.
  - While flexible, this approach can lead to stagnation or overly cautious increases.
  - By introducing a predictable exponential growth pattern as a client default, this EIP encourages a sustainable and transparent gas limit trajectory, aligned with expected advancements in hardware and protocol efficiency.
- [Adding flexibility to Ethereum’s exit queue](https://ethresear.ch/t/adding-flexibility-to-ethereums-exit-queue/22061)
  - EIP-7922 implements this change. We first redenominate exits in terms of “amount of ETH” instead of “number of validators” because, with EIP-7251, validators may have different balances.
  - EIP-7922 constraint (using today’s stake numbers) - No more than 917504 =256 ⋅ 256 ⋅ 14 ETH can churn (2.7% of the total 34mm ETH staked) in 17 days.
- [Execution Dependencies](https://ethresear.ch/t/execution-dependencies/22150)
  - Most Ethereum blocks are highly parallelizable.
  - On average, 60–80% of transactions are completely independent, and dependency chains are shallow.
  - However, a small number of blocks have heavy entanglement and long critical paths, limiting parallelism — especially near the top-of-block (ToB), where MEV searchers compete for order.
  - Explore some transaction dependency graphs on [dependency.pics](https://dependency.pics/).
- [EIP-2935: A Step to Achieving Stateless Execution](https://research.2077.xyz/eip-2935-a-step-to-achieving-stateless-execution#brief-overview-of-ethereum%E2%80%99s-current-structure)
  - EIP-2935 brings Ethereum closer to statelessness by storing 8192 past block hashes, enabling efficient execution for lightweight and stateless clients.
  - Making Trustless Oracle Systems Faster
    - In Uniswap v2-based oracles, anyone with Ethereum node access can generate a proof of Uniswap’s storage and submit it for on-chain validation. The average price is determined between the current block and the supplied proof’s block, with validated proof up to 256 blocks, since the blockHash supports up to 256 blocks. Benefiting from EIP-2935, this process can be improved by allowing access to older block hashes, which means proofs can be validated over a longer period.
  - Allowing Contracts to Consider Past State Assertions, Trustlessly\
  - EIP-2935 improvement creates the possibility to look at blockchain data from inside the EVM, trustlessly. A client can query the history, get it hashed, and verify it with other nodes. The solution could make light clients efficient and easy to implement.
  - Bridging between L1 <> L2
    - To verify a message from L2, L1 needs to know about L2 state roots and block hashes. However, L1 in its current state can’t access arbitrary block hashes due to gas limits and architectural constraints. EIP-2935 enables L1 to verify the arbitrary historic data with the ability to probe inclusion proofs for old events. The access and verification power will improve, and the bridging performance.

## Rollup

- [Only rollups without meaningful MEV should be based.](https://x.com/_charlienoyes/status/1887535538317762987)
  - A truly based rollup, which operates without a trusted gateway, is ordered by L1 validators or builders.
    - the based sequencer will be maximally extracting MEV, and thus the based rollup will not be able to compete with Hyperliquid or Unichain or Atlas.
  - To solve this, people came up with the idea of "trusted gateway" based rollups.
    - These trusted gateways are supposed to offer preconfirmations and decline to maximally extract MEV.
    - Some suggest that the trusted gateway should operate inside of a TEE to enforce these gaurentees (because they are incentive-incompatible).
  - it is strictly better for Base to operate its own sequencer in a TEE than it is for them to hire a 3rd party "trusted gateway" to do so, which has different security practices and incentives. It is an unnecessary and risky layer of indirection.
- [Based Rollup's pre-confirmation may not be compatible with L1 interoperability](https://x.com/benafisch/status/1889524328816841060)
  - Unlike rollup sequencers, each L1 proposer cannot provide fast confirmations because it has limited control over whether its proposal will be accepted by Ethereum consensus. It does not matter if the L1 proposer stakes a large amount. It can only promise to propose a unique block. It can be slashed for proposing multiple blocks or for missing its proposal entirely, but regardless, it cannot confirm with certainty the state of the L2 either during the 12 second period it is building the block or immediately after.
  - To compose with the L1, a based rollup needs to produce real-time proofs and to build its L2 state off of the current L1 block. In other words, L2 blocks are treated just like any other transaction submitted to the L1.
  - This means L2 transactions are exposed to the same short-term reorg risk as L1 transactions and take just as long to confirm. Even publishing these L2 blocks to Espresso Network does not save them from this reorg risk.
- [Economic Censorship Games in Fraud Proofs](https://research.arbitrum.io/t/economic-censorship-games-in-fraud-proofs/9722)
  - Optimistic rollups grant a 7-day challenge period in their fraud proof systems to mitigate against a strong censorship attack, where the potential adversary controls so much of Ethereum’s stake to allow for complete jurisdiction over which blocks get accepted as part of the canonical chain.
  - However, other forms of censorship are possible and it is important to understand their implications for rollup security — in particular how the length of the challenge period is related to that security.
  - we study economic censorship attacks in which an adversary bribes Ethereum’s block builders/proposers to exclude the honest party’s moves in the challenge protocol, by offering them a payment higher than the honest party’s inclusion tip. This is particularly relevant today, as the grand majority of Ethereum blocks are built through the MEV-Boost auction.
  - In the fraud proof context, whenever it is the honest party’s turn to submit the next protocol move (which is an Ethereum transaction), the adversary can choose whether to censor that move at the cost of the bribe, or let that move through while conserving funds for future censorship.
  - The honest party, on the other hand, can offer higher or lower inclusion tips as a response to the adversary’s choices.
- [Given some misunderstandings of how OFT tokens work when used as a gas token](https://x.com/bkiepuszewski/status/1897735912890433825)
  - Omnichain Fungible Tokens (OFTs) are a new cross-chain token standard introduced by LayerZero, and have already been adopted by projects like Avalanche, PancakeSwap, and Trader Joe.
  - let's have a look at the very specific example -
    @SankoGameCorp L3 which is an Orbit chain on @arbitrum
  - Sanko uses $DMT as a gas token
  - If Arbitrum and Sanko were Stage2 chains, $DMT on Sanko would be as secure as $DMT on Arbitrum
  - how do you make $DMT an OFT in this setup ? First you need to pre-mint more $DMT for OFT liquidity.
  - his trick "bypasses" canonical bridge and suddenly there's 1,000,000 more $DMT on Sanko, completely unbacked.
  - As a gas token is needed to pay for every transaction in Sanko, the whole chain's security is reduced to trusting LayerZero. Obviously with this setup Sanko is Stage0 at best which can be surprising considering the potential investment in maintaining a proof system, etc..

  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GniQ6IaboAA2bOH?format=png&name=medium)
  - Deploy Solidity & Vyper contracts without recompilation — just like on Ethereum.
  - Works with Foundry, Hardhat, and Remix natively, no plugins needed.
  - Same address derivation (create, create2) as Ethereum.
  - Pre-deployed contracts (Create2 Proxy, Safe Factory, Multicall3…) for seamless onboarding.
  - Some limitations remain (e.g., higher gas costs than native EraVM, no delegatecall between EVM and EraVM).
- [Unstoppable Ethereum Rollups](https://facet.org/beyond-stage-2-the-case-for-unstoppable-ethereum-rollups)
  - even at Stage 2—the highest maturity level—rollups are still permitted to censor users or halt entirely. The only requirement is a 30‑day “exit window” before such changes take effect, theoretically allowing users to withdraw their assets in time.
    - Prohibitive exit costs
    - Interaction with application‐level constraints on withdrawals
    - A lack of trust‐minimized withdrawals for L2‐native assets
  - an Unstoppable Rollup provides two guarantees:
    - Continuous and Uncensorable Transaction Inclusion: No one can indefinitely halt block production or selectively censor transactions. There must always be a fallback (forced inclusion) that cannot be disabled.
    - Gas Token Integrity: No one can disable or manipulate the rollup’s gas token, e.g., freezing issuance or inflating supply. Either scenario effectively blocks normal chain usage.
  - There are three primary architectural approaches to eliminate these administrative control vectors:
    - Immutable L1 Contracts with User-Driven Migration: Use L1 contracts for bridging/sequencing but make them non‐upgradeable. When protocol upgrades are needed, deploy a new rollup with new immutable contracts. Users who want the upgraded logic must withdraw from the old rollup and redeposit into the new one. While inconvenient, the old rollup never forcibly shuts down.
    - Sovereign Rollups (No L1 Contracts for Core Logic): Eliminate reliance on L1 contracts entirely and define the rollup’s state transition function entirely off-chain. Sovereign rollups rely on social consensus for upgrades and handle bridging as an application-layer function without any privileged canonical bridge. Unstoppable sovereign rollups adopt a native gas token to remove dependence on an L1 bridge contract.
    - Native Rollups (Validation Integrated with Ethereum Protocol): Embed rollup validation logic directly into Ethereum’s consensus/protocol. Here, Ethereum’s social consensus governs upgrades via L1 hard forks—no single rollup admin has the power to force changes. This enables native rollups to use immutable L1 contracts without requiring users to withdraw and redeposit on protocol upgrades. Native rollups promise the most UX-friendly path to unstoppability, but require major Ethereum protocol modifications.
- [Enshrined Native L2s and Stateless Block Building](https://ethresear.ch/t/enshrined-native-l2s-and-stateless-block-building/22079)
  - Enshrined native L2s extend Ethereum’s validator set beyond L1 duties
    - We can take validators not proposing or attesting on L1 (e.g., due to rotation in systems like Orbit) and shift them to L2s, forming committees to handle transaction sequencing and block production. e.g. we could have committees of 96 validators per L2, with 16 validators assigned to FOCIL/proposing duties and the rest attesting.
    - This leverages the fact that, in systems like Orbit, ~80% of validator stake might be active on L1, leaving ~20% available for L2s, amplifying native blockspace.
  - The Necessity of Stateless Block Building
    - stateless block building is desirable. Validators can’t store the full state as storage requirements continue to grow even on L1 and much less including all L2s.
    - How It Works: Users or state providers supply witnesses (state data + proofs) with transactions.
    - Why It Matters: Statelessness keeps hardware requirements low, enabling fast transitions between L1 and L2 duties.

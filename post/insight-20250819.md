- [Are there any permissionless 4337 bundlers?](https://x.com/rimeissner/status/1943602436192489865)
  - The lack of infrastructure for public UserOp mempool submission could slow down EIP-7702 adoption and introduce centralization and censorship risks.
  - [To address this, the Ethereum Foundation has approved a grant for the Etherspot team to develop and launch publicly accessible, censorship-resistant UserOp mempool nodes.](https://x.com/etherspot/status/1955256035540648303)
  - The EIP-7702 infrastructure will be free for any project or individual developer building across the EVM ecosystem (within reasonable usage of course).

- [ERC-7806: Minimal intent-centric EOA smart account](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7806)
  - ERC-4337 has several limitations
    - Complexity
    - Compatibility
    - Cost
    - Trust Assumption
  - ERC-7521 introduced a smart contract account (SCA) solution with an intent-centric design. It allows solvers to fulfill account owners‚Äô intents while maintaining flexibility for custom execution logic and ensuring forward compatibility.

  ![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJLF-f3Bxl.png)
  - attesters or the PTC of slot N can also condition their votes on IL bitlist inclusivity
    - Using attesters of slot N
      - The primary advantage is that it leverages the entire beacon committee, but it means a beacon block can be reorged because it fails to satisfy the IL bitlist inclusivity check.
    - Using the PTC of slot N
      - Alternatively, the PTC can perform the IL bitlist inclusivity check. This approach creates a cleaner abstraction by protecting the beacon chain from being reorged due to IL-related conditions.

- [BuilderNet and the Return of Exclusive Orderflow‚ÄîWith Extra Steps](https://eigenphi.substack.com/p/buildernet-and-return-of-exclusive-orderflow)
  - One of BuilderNet‚Äôs core promises is to move Ethereum away from exclusive, opaque orderflow relationships that fueled centralization in the current builder landscape.
  - In practice, however, signs are emerging that these exclusivity dynamics are returning, just under a more complex wrapper.

## Protocol

- [lean Ethereum](https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/07/31/lean-ethereum)
  - lean consensus is beacon chain 2.0: hardened for ultimate security and decentralization, plus finality in seconds; formerly branded as "beam chain"
  - lean data is blobs 2.0: post-quantum blobs, plus granular blob sizing for a calldata-like developer experience
  - lean execution is EVM 2.0: a minimal, SNARK-friendly instruction set (possibly RISC-V; pronounced "risk five"), boosting performance while preserving EVM compatibility and its network effects
- [EIP-7907 (contract code size increase) was officially removed due to unresolved complexity and timeline risk.](https://x.com/eth_everstake/status/1946245421476487502)

  - Some argued it‚Äôs just a ‚Äú2-line change‚Äù.
  - Others flagged last-minute complexity.
  - Besu called for a hard spec freeze there.
  - Arbitrum proposed a simpler +50% bump.
  - Eventually, teams agreed to defer it to Glamsterdam.

- [all Ethereum execution clients support history pruning for pre-merge data](https://x.com/lightclients/status/1942562800166989869)
  - For mainnet, this means 300-500 GB less disk space required to operate a node.
  - Archive node users & application developers who need the history to generate custom indexes will need to begin migrating to external history providers as the history will become less available over the p2p with time. A list of providers can be found here: https://eth-clients.github.io/history-endpoints/

- [Capping Transaction Gas: Data, Impact, and Rationale](https://ethresear.ch/t/capping-transaction-gas-data-impact-and-rationale/22738)
  - Impact of introducing a cap at ~16.7m is highly concentrated among a small number of sophisticated users/apps
    - XEN Contracts & XEN Users
  - Economic impact is minimal (max individual cost for user < 0.27 ETH over 6 months)
  - The gas cap would improve DoS resistance and parallelization potential without significant disruption
- [Blob Notaries: a distributed blob publishing design to scale DA](https://ethresear.ch/t/blob-notaries-a-distributed-blob-publishing-design-to-scale-da/22709)

- [ePBS (EIP-7732) & The ‚ÄúFree Option Problem‚Äù](https://collective.flashbots.net/t/the-free-option-problem-in-epbs/5115)
  ![](https://collective.flashbots.net/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6f8eb97cd8c03359a4459e02765acf2c955a082d.png)
  - The issue arises because builders are given two deadlines to deliver a payload and blobs.
  - They can exploit the second deadline, particularly the 10-second window for blob submission, to strategically invalidate a block after market conditions have changed.
  - If a builder realizes that their previously submitted block is no longer favorable (for example, due to new price action or MEV opportunities), they can choose not to submit the blob and cause the block to be discarded.
  - Flashbots simulated the economic value of this option using Binance trading data and found that such a mechanism could yield more than $1.2 million per day in arbitrage profits if Ethereum matched Binance-level liquidity.

- [Why does Ethereum need to increase the gas cost of the ModExp precompile?](https://x.com/marcin_d_s/status/1889748795618984034)
  - The current pricing formula sets the minimum gas cost at 200. However, real-world scenarios with minimum-priced precompile calls show performance that is 2‚Äì2.5 times slower than EcRecover. To address this, we propose increasing the minimum gas cost from 200 to 500.
  - dditionally, there are underpriced worst-performing edge case scenarios. We are addressing these by increasing the pricing for cases where the base, modulo, or exponent exceeds 32 bytes. Exact changes are shown in the picture.
- [Overclocking Blocks with Gas Refunds](https://ethresear.ch/t/overclocking-blocks-with-gas-refunds/22862/1)

  - Importantly, the gas refund of one transaction can be consumed by another transaction.
  - While gas refunds effectively incentivize storage cleanup, their current implementation reduces the total gas usage counted against the block gas limit
  - As a result, the block‚Äôs gas usage understates the actual computational effort performed.

- [An Ethereum Prover Market Proposal](https://ethresear.ch/t/an-ethereum-prover-market-proposal/22834)
  - This post proposes to implement a prover market on Ethereum
    - It allows builders to connect with a permissionless set of provers.
    - Builders, with help from the Ethereum protocol, deposit a prize for proofs into a system contract while building the block.
    - Anyone who submits a proof may collect a part of the prize in the next slot.
    - Attesters enforce that payments are delivered.
  - Ethereum may not need a prover market if either:
    - There is at least one altruistic prover online at all times for all proving systems.
    - Builders are provers.

## Rollup

- [Preemptive Provable Assertions](https://x.com/ethresearchbot/status/1945703623754719631)
  - L2 users can make transactions based on future state assertions, which must be proven later.
  - The mechanism allows for real-time updates from L1 to L2, enhancing the responsiveness of applications.
  - Interdependent transactions on L2 can be coordinated more effectively, reducing the risk of one party taking advantage of another.
  - Cross-rollup assertions can ensure that transactions across different rollups are atomic, meaning they either both happen or neither does.
  - The proposed framework allows developers to create flexible systems while managing risks associated with complex assertions.

  - The network got slower in June ‚Äî and it wasn‚Äôt for tech-related reasons
  - More order flow means more fee opportunities, so it can be more lucrative for validators to see and process 500ms worth of transactions as opposed to 300ms, for instance.

- [$40M GMX Exploit: AUM Manipulation](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GvWJoZSXcAA-3Hz?format=jpg&name=medium)

  - `redeem_amount = (user_GLP / total_GLP_supply) * AUM`
  - `AUM =   sum(token_pool_value) + unrealized losses from global shorts - unrealized profits from global shorts - reserved amounts - configured deductions (aumDeduction)`
  - When a short position is opened, it immediately increases the global short size.
  - If the price hasn‚Äôt moved yet, the system assumes the short is losing money, which is treated as an asset (unrealized loss) for the vault.

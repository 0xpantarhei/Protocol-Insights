- [Account Abstraction 2024](https://blog.rhinestone.wtf/account-abstraction-2024-1d35f811f391)

  - ERC-4337 infrastructure is beautiful but complex. Its uncompromising objective of being decentralized introduces attack vectors that would not exist under a more centralized system.
  - Systems with lower latency or specialized features may outcompete fully compliant 4337 infrastructure within specific product verticals.
  - In these verticals, the open mempool becomes a fallback for liveness and censorship.
  - We may also see supporters of EIP-7702 opt for a more minimalist transaction infrastructure.
  - **Intent-based systems:** Successful solvers run highly performant, bespoke systems to manage liquidity and protocol routing. ERC-4337 introduces another layer of complexity that will be slowly adopted or avoided altogether. As intent systems grow, we expect 4337’s market share to fall.
  - **Account Automation (incl. AI agents):** The userOp validation phase has storage restrictions to prevent DOS attacks. This imposes design restrictions when automating account behavior in response to external systems. This could motivate bundlers to break 4337 compliance and remain private, opening the door to other competing systems.

- [Zerodev UltraRelay](https://x.com/decentrek/status/1879575439011979563)

  - <https://basescan.org/tx/0xaf6e981e896678ba7046b871c338823e6e03ecfa84778f90df06f12c452f529d>

  - Comparing to ERC-4337 bundlers & paymasters, UltraRelay is:
    - 30% cheaper
    - 40% faster
      - Currently, sponsoring UserOps involves complex interactions between bundlers and paymasters, adding significant RPC latency.
    - Supports cross-chain transactions
  - ERC-4337 is a general-purpose AA protocol. In practice, however, most AA use cases today follow a very specific pattern: DApps sponsoring gas for embedded wallets.
    - We know that users won't be using malicious smart accounts, because their embedded wallets are created through the ZeroDev SDK. ​
    - We know that both the bundlers and the paymasters are managed by the same entity (ZeroDev).
  - ZeroDev has developed a new AA infrastructure using ERC-7683 fillers, which we are calling UltraRelay.
    - **Trusting the account -- merging validation with execution**
    - **Trusting the sponsor -- merging bundlers & paymasters**
    - **Building on ERC-7683 intents**
      - UltraRelay is a ERC-7683 filler, so any ERC-7683 fillers can technically relay transactions for smart accounts that support UltraRelay.

## Preconf

- [A Pricing Model for Inclusion Preconfirmations](https://research.lido.fi/t/a-pricing-model-for-inclusion-preconfirmations/9136)

  - In this model, we argue that the lowest value block-space approximates the value that should be required by a proposer to provide an inclusion preconf. The intuition here is that a proposer gives up this lowest value block-space when providing an inclusion preconf, although their is nuance to this statement, which we discuss when introducing the model.
  - Summarised in the graph below, per-gas inclusion preconf tips scale up with two factors: **already preconfirmed gas amount and transaction size**. A typical 21k gas ETH transfer sees inclusion preconf tips from 0.61 GWEI (0 already preconfirmed gas) to 1.17 GWEI (15M already preconfirmed gas), and beyond. With this model in hand, proposers can begin to reasonably determine the price of an incoming inclusion preconf.

    ![image-20250116-093913.png](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/f/f403a6de51ff19665dfd8ed1fcea69aad21a0898_2_1380x904.jpeg)

- [Preconfirmation for the Average Joee](https://x.com/ceciliaz030/status/1875558701324759392?s=12)

  - ![image-20250116-094428.png](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GgczPnAa4AAclnF?format=jpg&name=medium)
  - Currently, only Inclusion Preconf exists, which means the gateway can only guarantee the inclusion of transactions. However, a caveat is contentious activities should be avoided when using this service. If you try to ape memecoins using preconfirmation, your transaction might fail when it reaches L1 because the coin would have been sold out.
  - A more advanced type called Execution Preconf could have greater significance, especially for certain applications. With Execution Preconf, if you're swapping tokens, you are promised the pool's outcome, including price and amount with slippage—not just confirmation that your swap was included (which could still fail). This sophisticated version is more difficult to price and will cost more.
  - There are some potential implementations for improving slippage.
    - With execution preconfirmation, it’s possible for service providers to insure you against a range of slippage - [validators will commit to the insured states](https://ethresear.ch/t/based-proposer-commitments-ethereum-s-marketplace-for-proposer-commitments/19517), and then searchers or builders can fulfill the criteria.
    - Without execution preconfirmation, the wallet can integrate DEX with [Application-Specific Sequencing (ASS)](https://sorellalabs.xyz/writing/a-new-era-of-defi-with-ass) and connect to the app-specific mempool. This allows your transaction to be included as part of the ASS bundle by inclusion preconfirmation.
  - What about gas sponsorship and the batching of UserOps?
    - Batch as much as possible to amortize user cost;
    - Settle in the future instead of every slot to lower fixed costs;
    - Provide instant preconfimation to users.

## MEV

- [Chainlink Smart Value Recapture (SVR)](https://x.com/chainlink/status/1871241636211982752)

- [How MEV-aware protocols work](https://x.com/decentrek/status/1870088512059625527)
  - On-chain auction aka "gas race"
    - A gas race auction doesn't rely on a centralized server for auction, but leaks MEV to the block proposer / sequencer, and doesn't give users the best price.
  - Off-chain auction aka "relayer exclusivity"
    - An off-chain auction can potentially give users the best price, but it requires trusting a server.
  - Tribunal's idea is simple and beautiful:
    - The more gas a solver pays, the more the solver must pay the user.
    - Imagine that there's an intent that says "100 USDC on Arb => 99 USDC on Base." In other words, the solver earns 1 USDC in fees.
      - In a normal gas race, the solver would pay up to 0.99 USDC in gas to win the auction.
      - But now imagine if, for any amount the solver pays in gas, the solver must also pay the same amount to the user. For example, if the solver pays 0.1 USDC in gas, then the solver must pay 0.1 USDC to the user, changing the intent to "100 USDC on Arb => 99.1 USDC on Base."

## Protocol

- [Block-level fee markets: Four easy pieces](https://ethresear.ch/t/block-level-fee-markets-four-easy-pieces/21448)

  - . We can differentiate between two approaches to obtaining a fee market:
    - **Direct pricing:** A user brings their transaction to the protocol, which prices the resources used by the transaction and charges the user some protocol-determined price for their use.
    - **Mediated pricing:** A party (say, a _broker_) buys a set of resources from the protocol and re-sells these resources to users who demand them. The brokers are responsible for ensuring their own budget-balance, and broker competition achieves efficiency under certain conditions.
  - Two different ways to _meter_ resources offered by the protocol to its users
    - **Transaction-level metering:** The resources used by a transaction are metered strictly within the context of the transaction, with no other information than what the transaction itself consumes.
    - **Block-level metering:** The resources used by a transaction are metered within the context of the whole block, using information regarding what other transactions have consumed.
      - **Claim 1:** Block-level metering obtains in general better allocations of resources.
        - We mean this in the sense that by using the whole information of resources consumed throughout the block, block-level metering loosens the budget constraint faced by users and block producers, allowing for more bang for our resource bucks. This sounds great, so how can we get block-level metering essentially for free?
      - **Claim 2:** Block-level metering is very easy to pair with mediated pricing of resources.
        - By introducing a broker responsible for buying “in bulk” the resources from the protocol, and letting the broker figure out the resource allocation which unlocks the biggest bang for their buck, the protocol need not concern itself with directly pricing resources. This gives us a generic method for unlocking scalability improvements via block-level metering.
      - **Claim 3:** Some desirable allocations unlocked with block-level metering cannot be satisfyingly obtained with direct pricing of resources.

- [Block-Level Warming](https://ethresear.ch/t/block-level-warming/21452)

  - Currently, the EVM’s storage slot warming mechanism operates at the transaction level, requiring each transaction to “warm up” slots independently, even when accessing the same storage locations within the same block.
  - Allow accessed addresses and storage keys to maintain their “warm” status throughout an entire block’s execution.

- [A proposal to use network coding when propagating blocks and blobs](https://ethresear.ch/t/faster-block-blob-propagation-in-ethereum/21370)

  - The current [gossipsub](https://github.com/libp2p/specs) mechanism for distribution of blocks roughly works as follows
    - The proposer picks a random subset (called its _Mesh_) of D=8 peers among all of its peers and broadcasts its block to them.
    - Each peer receiving a block performs some very fast preliminary validation: mostly signature verification, but most importantly not including state transition nor execution of transactions.
    - After this fast validation, the peer rebroadcasts its block to another D peers. There are two immediate consequences from such a design:
      - Each hop adds at least the following delay: one full block transfer from one peer to the next one (including both network ping latency, essentially bandwidth independent, plus transfer of the full block, bound by bandwidth).
      - Peers broadcast unnecessarily a full block to other peers that have already received the full block.
  - using[random linear network coding (RLNC)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1228459) at the broadcast level
    - With this coding, the proposer would split the block in N chunks (eg. N=10 for all simulations below)
    - and instead of sending a full block to ~8 peers, it will send a single chunk to ~40 peers (not one of the original chunks, but rather a random linear combination of them, see below for privacy considerations).
    - Peers still need to download a full block, or rather N chunks, but they can get them in parallel from different peers.
    - After they have received these N chunks that each is a random linear combination of the original chunks composing the original block, peers need to solve a linear system of equations to recover the full block.
  - **We show that we can theoretically distribute the block consuming 5% of the bandwidth and with 57% of the number of network hops (thus half the latency per message) of the time it takes on the current gossipsub implementation**
    - Proposing a block takes extra 26ms that are CPU bound and can be fully parallelized to less than 2ms on a modern laptop (Apple M4 Pro)
    - Verifying each chunk takes 2.6ms.
    - Decoding the full block takes 1.4ms.
    - With 10 chunks and D=40, each node sends half the data than with current gossipsub and the network broadcasts a 100KB block in half the time with benefits increasing with block size.

  - **The primary reason for unbundling designs like Proposer-Builder Separation (PBS) and Attester-Proposer Separation (APS) has been to preserve the decentralization of the participants in the core Proof of Stake mechanism such that they can hold more centralized participants accountable.**
  - By separating the roles that benefit from economies of scale from those that do not, Ethereum can preserve the decentralization amongst the participants of the roles where there are no economies of scale.

## Rollup

- Embedded Rollups

  - [Embedded Rollups, Part 1: Introduction](https://ethresear.ch/t/embedded-rollups-part-1-introduction/21460)

    - When Rollup A embeds another rollup ER (for embedded rollup), it maintains a _local view_ of the ER's state alongside its own - effectively _embedding_ the ER's state within itself
    - Embedded rollups allow multiple rollups to share a read-only state, improving cross-rollup interoperability without relying on the main blockchain (L1).
    - They can be used for shared key-value stores, enabling applications like ENS to update domain names across rollups without waiting for main blockchain confirmations.

      ![image-20250119-050423.png](https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/3X/4/0/40004c94e8dba61a0b326f7cb9a001cd70c0b6bb.png)

    - A shared bridge rollup can facilitate fast and efficient token transfers between rollups without costly main blockchain transactions.
    - Embedded rollups can be implemented using existing virtual machines like the EVM, making them easier to integrate into current systems.
    - There are two main ways to handle the settlement of embedded rollups: contingent settlement, which ensures consistency but adds complexity, and sovereign settlement, which maintains independence but may lead to inconsistencies.

  - [Embedded Rollups, Part 2: Shared Bridging](https://ethresear.ch/t/embedded-rollups-part-2-shared-bridging/21461)
    - Embedded rollups can create a shared bridge between L2s, allowing for fast and cheap interoperability without needing to execute transactions on L1.
    - Current methods for moving assets between L2s are either slow and expensive or require complex third-party solutions that can lead to liquidity fragmentation.
    - The shared bridge maintains a unified ledger of token balances across L2s, reducing the need for L1 transactions and improving efficiency.
    - Fast transfers can be facilitated by solvers who maintain liquidity in the shared bridge, allowing for quick cross-L2 token transfers.
    - The shared bridge approach democratizes access to solving by removing settlement risk, making it accessible to non-professionals.

  - Aztec utilizes the UTXO model for private state management and the account-based model for public state management.
  - Public state is universal (i.e. one for the whole network and available for anyone) while private state is individual to every user.
  - How can the note be destroyed in an append-only mode? Using nullifiers.

      - Bob then can decrypt the note and get access to the $10 transferred to him by Alice. No other action is required because in Alice's transaction, she has already added the commitment to Bob's note ($10) to the database.

  - A critical inefficiency in L2 block building that resembles a priority gas auction (PGA), where competing proposers rush to include transactions before Taiko Labs’ proposer.
  - This results in L2 blocks with redundant transactions being posted on-chain on L1, reducing the value of Taiko’s blocks and increasing its economic costs.
  - Inefficiency Caused by Redundant Transactions
    - redundant transactions occur when multiple L2 blocks containing the same transactions are published to L1.
    - In such cases, both blocks are submitted to L1, consuming valuable blob space and incurring L1 fees for the L2 proposer.
    - The first block processed on L1 is executed to determine the updated L2 state.
    - Any redundant transactions in the second block, already included in the first, are invalidated, as their state transitions have already been applied.
    - Unique transactions in the second block remain valid and still affect the L2 state.
    - **The proposer of the second block faces significant economic inefficiencies. They incur the full cost of posting and proving the block but only earn rewards for valid, non-redundant transactions.**
    - This dynamic discourages proposers from submitting redundant blocks. Additionally, posting two blocks to the same L1 slot reduces the effective throughput of the network by occupying valuable block space with redundant data blobs, increasing congestion and costs.

- [The 5 Levels of Secure Hardware](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2024/11/the-5-levels-of-secure-hardware)

  - Level 1: Allows building basic applications like oracles or bridges. The developer experience is not great, but the performance is acceptable for these applications. Security is based on proprietary supply chains.
  - Level 2: The performance is slightly worse, but the developer experience is better, allowing more expressive applications such as social media account delegation like Teleport. No security improvements.
  - Level 3: Great developer experience, near native performance, supports GPUs. Allows testing the limits of secure hardware with applications like private or verifiable ML inference. No security improvements. We are here, **developers can build most of the exciting things that “endgame” programmable cryptography enables today.**
  - Level 4: Security improves by having an open manufacturing process of secure hardware, while developer experience and performance stay constant. Allows us to scale the benefits of programmable cryptography safely, without relying on proprietary manufacturers.
  - Level 5: Security improves by having heterogeneous open secure hardware connected to each other for redundancy. We can reliably use secure hardware at global scale for things like voting or handling sensitive medical data.

    ![image-20250117-090354.png](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GfibfcgbMAAJuJm?format=jpg&name=medium)

    - NMTs allow appchains to efficiently verify & retrieve their specific data within the "super blob."
    - Rollups get strong guarantees that their data is untouched and accessible.
